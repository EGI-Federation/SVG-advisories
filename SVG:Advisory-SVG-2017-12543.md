Title:       EGI SVG ADVISORY [TLP:WHITE] 'CRITICAL' risk vulnerability concerning VOMS Admin
            [EGI-SVG-2017-12543]

Date:        2017-03-20
Updated:     2017-03-27, 2017-07-04

Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning VOMS Admin.

Package : VOMS Admin

Various vulnerabilities have been found concerning voms-admin.
These include the ability for a user to gain privileged (but not root) access.

Actions required
================

Sites running VOMS Admin are required to urgently install version 3.6.0.

All running resources MUST be either patched or have mitigation in place or software removed by 2017-04-04  00:00 UTC

Sites failing to act and/or failing to respond to requests from the EGI CSIRT team risk site suspension.


Affected software details
=========================

This is fixed in VOMS Admin 3.6.0

All VOMS versions prior to this release are affected.

VOMS Admin versions >= 3.4.0 and < 3.5.2 are vulnerable to unauthenticated attacks.

VOMS Admin v. < 3.4.0 allow the attack only to authenticated clients.


More information
================

These vulnerabilities are publicly known vulnerabilities in Apache Struts, on which VOMS admin depends.

In the case where VOMS admin >= 3.4.0 and < 3.5.2 an unauthenticated user is able to exploit this
vulnerability and gain privileged access.

Most sites running VOMS have already installed VOMS Admin 3.5.2 to block unauthenticated attacks.

Mitigation
==========

Mitigation is possible by restricting access to port 8443 to only known, trusted hosts.
