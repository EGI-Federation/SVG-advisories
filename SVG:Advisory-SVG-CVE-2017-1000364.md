    Title:       EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] 'HIGH' risk - Stack clash memory allocation vulnerability  CVE-2017-1000364  [EGI-SVG-CVE-2017-1000364]

    Date:        2017-06-21 (Heads up)
    Updated:     2017-07-11


    Affected software and risk
    ==========================

    'HIGH' risk vulnerability concerning the linux kernel and glibc

    Package : Linux Kernel, glibc
    CVE ID  : CVE-2017-1000364, CVE-2017-1000366

    A memory allocation vulnerability has been found which may allow an authorized user
    to gain root privileges. [R 1] [R 2] [R 3] [R 4] [R 5] [R 6].

    For the EGI infrastructure this affects Worker Nodes (WNs), shared User interface (UI) instances,
    and in the EGI Federated cloud Virtual Machines (VMs) which distinguish between privileged and unprivileged users.

    Actions required/recommended
    ============================

    Sites are recommended to update as soon as possible, if they have not done so already.

    For sites using 32 bit machines, update is urgent as the vulnerability is 'Critical' in this case.

    For the kernel updates, it should be noted that updating requires a re-boot.

    In the 'Heads up' on 2017-06-21 We did not recommend action, as there appeared to be problems with the updates.
    See [R 7] [R 8] [R 9].


    Affected software details
    =========================

    All versions of Linux are affected.

    Exploit is much more difficult / time consuming on 64bit than on 32bit.
    If 32 bit machines are still in use sites should take action more urgently.

    More information
    ================


    For more information see [R 10]

    There were reported problems with Java Virtual Machine (JVM), on which some software used in EGI depends [R 12].
    We understand this is now resolved with the latest versions of linux.


    TLP and URL
    ===========

    Yyyy-mm-dd  [EGI-SVG-2017-CVE-2017-1000364]

    2017-06-19 (evening) SVG alerted to this issue by Sven Gabriel
    2017-06-20 Acknowledgement from the EGI SVG to the reporter
    2017-06-20 Investigation of vulnerability and relevance to EGI carried out
    2017-06-20 Updated packages available for most versions of linux
    2017-06-21 Appears that there are problems with these updates
    2017-06-21 SVG decided to send 'Heads up'
    2017-07-11 Recommend updating

    Context
    =======

    This 'heads up' has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's purpose
    "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software vulnerabilities"

    The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling procedure [R 11]
    in the context of how the software is used in the EGI infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group,
    we do not guarantee it to be correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending
    on how the software is used.

    Others may re-use this information provided they:-

    1) Respect the provided TLP classification
