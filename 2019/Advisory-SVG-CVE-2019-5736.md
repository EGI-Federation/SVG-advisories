         malicious container escape affecting Docker, Kubernetes, lxc
         [EGI-SVG-CVE-2019-5736]

Date:    2019-02-13
Updated: 2019-03-01

Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning runc used in Docker, Kubernetes, lxc

Package : runC/docker
CVE ID  : CVE-2019-5736

A flaw was found in the way runc handled system file descriptors when running
containers.
A malicious container could use this flaw to overwrite contents of the runc
binary and consequently run arbitrary commands on the container host system. [R
1] [R 2].  This affects Docker, Kubernetes, and lxc. Not all sites will be
vulnerable, see mitigation below.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running docker should update urgently, or ensure their site is mitigated
as below, if they have not done so already.

Note that the EGI CSIRT team will not be monitoring this CVE.


Component installation information
==================================

Sites installing docker directly from github may install the updated version [R
3]

**UPDATE 2019-02-26**

RedHat has produced advisories and updates for most supported platforms [R 4],
although for a few platforms they won't fix.

The Scientific Linux extras repository has updated docker and runc packages,
see your local mirror.

Any site using Debian should site [R 5]

The CentOS extras repository has updated docker and runc packages, see your
local mirror.


Mitigation
==========

From the Red Hat advisory: This vulnerability is mitigated by the use of
SELinux in targeted enforcing mode, which completely prevents this
vulnerability from being exploited. The default for SELinux on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7 is targeted enforcing mode.


More information
================

This advisory will be updated and a date will be set by which time all running
resources MUST be either patched or have mitigation in place or software
removed.

Note that a proof of concept exploit has been released publicly [R 6]

Use in Docker and Kubernetes  [R 7]
