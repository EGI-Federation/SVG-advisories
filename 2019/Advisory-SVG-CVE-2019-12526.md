Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' **UPDATE** [TLP:WHITE] HIGH risk Vulnerabilities in
         Squid CVE-2019-12526, CVE-2019-12523 and others
         [EGI-SVG-CVE-2019-12526]

Date:    2019-11-13
Updated: 2019-12-02  Updated Version of Frontier Squid available in EGI UMD.


Affected software and risk
==========================

HIGH risk vulnerabilities concerning Squid.

Package : Squid
CVE ID  : CVE-2019-12526, CVE-2019-12523

Several security issues have been found in Squid which have been announced by
the squid team and fixed in release 4.9 [R 1]

EGI SVG considers a couple of these vulnerabilities to be 'HIGH' risk with the
potential of being elevated to 'CRITICAL' in combination with others.

The ones we consider most serious are [R 2] and [R 3].

Many sites in EGI will be using frontier-squid (e.g. from the UMD) instead of
the squid version directly available from RHEL / CentOS.

**UPDATE 2019-12-02**

The version of frontier-squid with these vulnerabilities fixed is now available
in the EGI UMD.

We also remind sites of setting the Squid host firewall rules and the Squid
network ACLs as tightly as possible.

Actions required/recommended
============================

**UPDATE 2019-12-02**

Sites are recommended to install a non-vulnerable version of Squid, urgently if
they have not yet taken mitigating action after the previous advisory.

Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites is
repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD).

Sites using the EGI UMD 4 should see:

http://repository.egi.eu/category/umd_releases/distribution/umd-4/

The fixed version of Squid is part of the UMD-4.9.0 release.

http://repository.egi.eu/2019/11/26/release-umd-4-9-0/

The fixed version is available from the Squid team [R 1]

frontier-squid-4.9-2.1 has been released in the CERN distribution [R 4]

Other Mitigating action
=======================

For those using squid directly from Red Hat or CentOS, note that Red Hat is not
planning to apply all of the patches.
They are recommending a permanent mitigating action for CVE-2019-12526 [R 5] of
the following configuration lines:

    acl URN proto URN
    http_access deny URN



OSG Security team information
=============================

Multiple vulnerabilities have been publicly announced affecting all current
versions of frontier-squid-3.* and frontier-squid-4.*, including one that
potentially permits remote code execution and another that permits bypassing
access controls. An upgraded package is being prepared, but meanwhile a
workaround is available to block the remote code execution vulnerability. All
sites are encouraged to apply the workaround, especially those that are not
blocked from the internet by a firewall, and to watch for a further
announcement on the availability of a new frontier-squid version.

IMPACTED VERSIONS:

All frontier-squid-3.* and frontier-squid-4.* versions through
frontier-squid-4.8-2.1.  frontier-squid-2.* versions don't have these
vulnerabilities but they are deprecated.

WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

Vulnerability SQUID-2019:7 [1] describes a potential heap overflow in the URN
(Universal Resource Name) handling code that can potentially lead to remote
code execution or crash. This feature is not used by OSG clients but is enabled
by default. A workaround to disable it is below.

Vulnerability SQUID-2019:8 [2] describes several issues with URI (Universal
Resource Identifier) processing that permit remote clients to bypass access
controls or deny service to other clients. It discusses a workaround for a
third issue enabling access to manager services, but that workaround is already
in place by default.

Three other vulnerabilities were announced at the same time but they are not
applicable to the OSG.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Add these lines to /etc/squid/customize.sh and restart the frontier-squid
service, especially if your squid is accessible to the internet:

insertline("# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE", "acl URN proto URN")

insertline("# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE", "http_access deny URN")

Watch for a followup announcement of the availability of frontier-squid-4.9.

vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 6] in the context of how thesoftware is used in the EGI
infrastructure.  It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be
correct.  The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending
on how the software is used.

1) Respect the provided TLP classification

2) Credit the EGI https://www.egi.eu/ Software Vulnerability Group

Also in this case if re-using the OSG information please credit OSG.

Note that the SVG issue handling procedure is currently under review, to take
account of the increasing inhomogeneity of the EGI infrastructure and the
services in the EOSC-hub catalogue.
