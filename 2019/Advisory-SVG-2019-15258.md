Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] Up to 'CRITICAL' risk systemd-journald
         vulnerabilities [EGI-SVG-2019-15258]

Date:    2019-01-10
Updated: 2019-01-15   Updates available therefore Advisory issued.
         2019-05-14   Update to inform that an exploit has been released.

Affected software and risk
==========================

Up to CRITICAL risk vulnerabilities concerning systemd-journald

Package : systemd-journald
CVE ID  : CVE-2018-16864,CVE-2018-16865,CVE-2018-16866

A set of vulnerabilities in systemd-journald have been reported by Qualys[R 1]
which can be used in combination to lead to a local root privilege escalation
by any local user.

**UPDATE 2019-05-14** Qualys released their exploit [R 8]



Actions required/recommended
============================

*UPDATE 15/1/2019*: Patches are available for RedHat [R 5], SL [R 6] and CentOS
[R 7]. See also individual RedHat CVE  advisories [R 2][R 3][R 4].

Sites running systemd are urged to update relevant components. This will
primarily include sites that use RHEL/CentOS/SL.
The most urgent hosts to update are worker nodes and UIs where users would
typically have access to.

Sites should be aware that if a public exploit is released which allows easy
root access in the EGI infrastructure this vulnerability is likely to be
elevated to 'Critical' and sites will then be required to patch within 7 days
or risk suspension - Qualys have noted that they will publish a working
exploit.

Component installation information
==================================

The RPM installer for the new version of systemd will re-exec the systemd
daemon, so a reboot is not required.
Sites may in addition wish to restart the systemd-journald process using, for
example, `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
