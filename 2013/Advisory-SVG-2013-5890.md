Introduction
============

A vulnerability has been found in CVMFS where a user can gain root access.

This was fixed by the CVMFS team, reported to SVG and announced to the
'CVMFS talk' list on 13th August 2013

EGI SVG is sending this advisory to ensure all sites running CVMFS are
aware of the problem, in case some sites using CVMFS do not subscribe to
the CVMFS talk list and to inform of the risk category.

Sites running CVMFS should upgrade immediately.


Details
=======

A vulnerability has been found in CVMFS where a user can gain root access.
The bug is in the CVMFS clients, which allows a local user to gain root access.


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'Critical' risk by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment
Team


Affected software
=================

Versions of CVMFS prior to 2.1.13 and 2.0.21 are vulnerable.

cvmfs-2.1.14 and CernVM-FS 2.0.22 are the versions which sites are recommended
to run.

(Note that cvmfs 2.1.13 and 2.0.21 introduced another bug which affected atlas
and possibly other VOs. This was quickly fixed in cvmfs-2.1.14)


Component installation information
==================================


Sites using CVMFS should see the CVMFS portal

Recommendations
===============

Sites running CVMFS should update immediately

All running resources MUST be either patched or otherwise have a work-around
in place by 2013-08-21  T21:00+01:00. Sites failing to act and/or failing to
respond to requests from the EGI CSIRT team risk site suspension.
