Introduction
============

A vulnerability has been found in CREAM (Computing Resource Execution And
Management) job management software.  [R 1]

A vulnerability assessment (The active investigation of software for
vulnerabilities) of CREAM was carried out by the Autonomous University of
Barcelona in 2013, 4 vulnerabilities were initially found, which were resolved
in early 2014. A 5th vulnerability was later found which has proven more
difficult to resolve.

This will not be resolved.

Details
=======

This vulnerability is a DoS but only exploitable by a user who has valid user
submission credentials on the target CE.

An exploit has been written to prove it is possible to cause a DoS.

It has proven difficult to resolve this while keeping CREAM's functionality
without a complete redesign of a subsystem of the service. Since the DoS can be
carried out only by an authorized user exploit is considered unlikely.

Therefore it has been decided NOT to fix this but to inform sites.


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as "Low" risk by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment Team.


Affected software
=================

CREAM all versions.


Mitigation
==========

N/A



Recommendations
===============

No action is recommended.
