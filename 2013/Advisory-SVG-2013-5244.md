EGI CSIRT ADVISORY [EGI-ADV-20130322]
EGI SVG   ADVISORY [EGI-SVG-2013-5244]

Title:       CREAM Axis2 configuration file permissions [EGI-ADV-20130322]

Date:        2013-03-22
Updated:     2013-04-09

URL:         https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Advisory-SVG-2013-5244

Introduction
============

The default installation of glite-ce-yaim-cream-ce creates a configuration file
which contains Axis2 administration credentials. This file is created with
insecure permissions.

This advisory is updated as the software has been fixed in both the EMI 2
distribution and the EGI UMD 2.

Details
=======

The file $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ce-cream/WEB-INF/conf/axis2.xml contains
userName and password parameters. The password is randomly generated when the
CREAM RPM is installed. By default the axis2.xml configuration file is world
readable. An authenticated user could access this file and subsequently use
these credentials to administer the Axis service. Existing components could be
disabled or new components uploaded.

(Updated on 8th April 2013)

Updated RPMS are now available.

We strongly recommend sites update with the new version, especially if they
have not already carried out the mitigation action below.

This advisory continues to be distributed under the AMBER TLP restriction, and
will be made public in 2 weeks.


Risk Category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'HIGH' risk by the EGI CSIRT and EGI SVG.


Affected Software
=================

This has been confirmed in the version of CREAM which ships with UMD/EMI2.

This is fixed in the following files:

CREAM 1.14.4, CEMon 1.14.1
glite-ce-common-java-1.14.2-1.sl*.noarch.rpm
glite-ce-cream-1.14.4-1.sl*.noarch.rpm
glite-ce-cream-es-1.14.4-1.sl*.noarch.rpm
glite-ce-monitor-1.14.1-1.sl*.noarch.rpm

This is fixed in EMI 2 Update 10 and UMD release 2.4.1


Mitigation
==========

The group ownership and permissions on this file should be changed to prevent
authenticated users gaining access to this file.

On SL5

chgrp tomcat /var/lib/tomcat5/webapps/ce-cream/WEB-INF/conf/axis2.xml
chmod 640 /var/lib/tomcat5/webapps/ce-cream/WEB-INF/conf/axis2.xml

On SL6

chgrp tomcat /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/ce-cream/WEB-INF/conf/axis2.xml
chmod 640 /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/ce-cream/WEB-INF/conf/axis2.xml

We also recommend you change your Axis2 password in the event it has already been
compromised.

Generate a new password using "openssl rand -base64 15" and modify the password
parameter in axis2.xml accordingly.


This issue also affects glite-ce-cream-es and glite-ce-monitor. Similar
mitigations should be performed on these files, if applicable.
The axis2.xml files are located at
$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ce-cream-es/WEB-INF/conf/axis2.xml
and
$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ce-monitor/WEB-INF/conf/axis2.xml
