Introduction
============

A vulnerability has been found in FTS-3 [R 1] where configuration commands are
not authorized.

This has been fixed by the FTS-3 team some time ago.

FTS-2 is not affected.

As it was fixed a long time ago, and it's unlikely that sites are running
insecure

versions, this is not sent to sites but only placed on the wiki.


Details
=======

A vulnerability has been found in FTS-3 where configuration commands are not
properly authorized.

Additionally, in some circumstances a suspended or banned user may be able to
carry out configuration commands if they were able to carry out such commands
prior to the suspension.

This was fixed by the FTS-3 team.

This is included for completeness only on the wiki as it was fixed a long time
ago,

and the SVG was not aware that it was fixed.


FTS-2 which is available in UMD-2 is not affected.
