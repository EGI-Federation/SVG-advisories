in January and early February 2018.

EGI SVG has at present (14th September 2018) issued 3 advisories related to
Speculative Execution Vulnerabilities
[Advisory-SVG-CVE-2017-5753](./Advisory-SVG-CVE-2017-5753.md) in January 2018,
[Advisory-SVG-CVE-2018-3639](./Advisory-SVG-CVE-2018-3639.md) in May 2018 and

The important thing is that sites carry out recommended updates, including if
appropriate their kernel versions. In some cases this may result in reduced
performance, but the update should not be omitted because of this.

The [Wikipedia: Spectre (security
vulnerability)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectre_(security_vulnerability)
provides some information on the variants, the recommended changes concern
windows.
