Introduction
============

It has been demonstrated that it is possible for an authenticated user to
create VM images that appear as the trusted VMs in the AppDB for any given VO
in some OpenStack sites.

This is due to a configuration problem, and sites running Openstack are being
recommended to ensure they are configured correctly so that this cannot occur.


Details
=======

It has been demonstrated that it is possible for an authenticated user to
create VM images that appear as the trusted VMs in the AppDB for any given VO
in OpenStack sites.

A user with enough privileges to create images at a given site can create an
image with the appropriate metadata information so it appears as a trusted
image to the AppDB without any administrator approval or without any
real/trusted image being available at the site.  Any malicious VM image could
be uploaded with the data instead of the trusted ones and obtain valuable and
private user information.

This issue is only exploitable if: user is allowed to create images in
OpenStack and the metadata properties are not protected (default behaviour).


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'High' risk for those sites affected by the EGI
SVG Risk Assessment Team.


Affected software
=================

OpenStack.


Mitigation
==========

Sites using OpenStack in the EGI Federated cloud should prevent setting of
metadata using instructions in [R 3]

Further information on configuring sites is attached.


Component installation information
==================================

N/A.  This is a configuration issue.


Recommendations
===============

Initially, sites are recommended to carry out the mitigations above.


Other information
=================

This, of course, does not fully solve the problem. It should not be possible
for sites to provide images into the AppDB, regardless of site configuration,
without the appropriate endorsement.  Ensuring only appropriate endorsed images
are in the AppDB should not be purely dependent on site configuration.  Further
mechanisms will need to be put place to ensure that all images in the AppDB can
be trusted.
