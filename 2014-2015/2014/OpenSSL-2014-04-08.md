EGI CSIRT ADVISORY [EGI-ADV-20140408]

Title:       EGI SVG Advisory 'Critical' RISK - CVE-2014-0160 affecting OpenSSL [EGI-ADV-20140408]  **UPDATE**

Date:        2014-04-08
Updated:     2014-04-09

Introduction
============

A vulnerability has been found in OpenSSL which allows unauthenticated
remote attackers to access memory areas in vulnerable systems.

It has been assigned CVE-2014-0160 [R 1].

**UPDATE/CORRECTION**

In particular, note that Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS 6.4 and
earlier are not affected, *BUT* that all Scientific Linux 6.x versions
are vulnerable.


Details
=======

This vulnerability affects systems using OpenSSL.

OpenSSL has issued a brief advisory on this issue [R 2]
A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension
can be used to reveal up to 64kB of memory to a connected client or server.

This allows sensitive information like passwords, X509 private keys,
session cookies and contents of encrypted messages to be revealed to
an unauthenticated user.

Sites need to patch vulnerable systems, with priority given to servers
exposing SSL services, not forgetting to restart the services
afterwards.

Sites will then need new certificates for the previously vulnerable
hosts.

The vulnerability also affects client software that uses OpenSSL,
which means that clients that connect to a malicious server could
suffer from information leak.


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'Critical' by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment Team
and the CSIRT Team.


Affected software
=================

OpenSSL Versions 1.0.1 [a through f].

This issue is fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1g and in vendor-patched versions
of OpenSSL 1.0.1e.

Versions of OpenSSL earlier than 1.0.1 are not affected.

Linux distributions with vulnerable OpenSSL versions include RHEL 6.5
and derivatives, and Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS.

** IMPORTANT**

Please note that Scientific Linux has the to-be-updated-openssl-1.0.1
in ALL releases, not only the 6.5.

CentOS and RedHat only have openssl-1.0.1 in the 6.5 release.

So unlike CentOS and RedHat Enterprise Linux, Scientific Linux is
vulnerable for all 6.X releases.


For many releases the patch is applied to various versions.
A list of versions which are suitable for use/non vulnerable is given here:


- RedHat/CentOS/Scientific Linux:
    openssl-1.0.1e-16.el6_5.7

- Debian Wheezy:
    1.0.1e-2+deb7u6

- OpenSUSE 12.3:
    openssl-1.0.1e-1.44.1

  OpenSUSE 13.1:
     openssl-1.0.1e-11.32.1

- Fedora 19:
    openssl-1.0.1e-37.fc19.1

  Fedora 20:
    openssl-1.0.1e-37.fc20.1

- Ubuntu 13.10:
    1.0.1e-3ubuntu1.2

  Ubuntu 12.10:
    1.0.1c-3ubuntu2.7

  Ubuntu 12.04 LTS:
    1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12

An external extensive list of non-vulnerable versions is given in [R 4]




Mitigation
==========

N/A


Component installation information
==================================

All sites running a vulnerable OpenSSL version must upgrade to a
patched version. Updates have been released by all major vendors.

Priority should be given to servers exposing SSL services, not
forgetting to restart the services afterwards.

Then sites will need new re-keyed certificates for the previously
vulnerable hosts; i.e. new certificates not based on the potentially
exposed key-pair.

Once the site has installed the new certificates, the old ones must be
revoked.


Recommendations
===============

All running resources MUST be either patched or temporarily removed
from service as soon as possible, and at the latest by
2014-04-15T21:00+01:00. Sites failing to act and/or failing to respond
to requests from the EGI CSIRT team risk site suspension.

Sites will then need new re-keyed certificates for the previously
vulnerable hosts; i.e. new certificates not based on the potentially
exposed key-pair. EGI CSIRT recommends that this is done in a
staggered fashion according to how important/sensitive the services
are, to ease the load on CA:s. Please note that this should only be
done for hosts that have been running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL.

Sites should then revoke the old certificates.

Then, finally, sites need to evaluate what other information that has
been potentially exposed by this; e.g. passwords that were submitted
to vulnerable servers.
