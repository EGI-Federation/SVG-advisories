         CVE-2015-7613

Introduction
============

A number of Linux Kernel vulnerabilities have been found and fixed by the
software providers.

SVG has looked at these and the one which gives concern for EGI is
CVE-2015-7613. [R 1] While there is no exploit available at present, it is
potentially serious if an exploit were to become available.

Therefore sites are recommended to update when it is practical to do so, and be
aware that the risk could rise.

These were fixed as part of the Scientific linux release on 15th December.  [R
2]

Details
=======

Details at [R 1], [R 2] and [R 3], [R 4] and [R 5]

We are not aware of any exploit for this at present.


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'High' risk by 2 members of the EGI SVG Risk
Assessment Team and 'Moderate' by 2 others. It is not clear whether this will
ever be exploitable in EGI.



Affected software
=================

It would appear that this vulnerability affects multiple Linux operating
systems.

Red Hat and its derivatives are affected. [R 3]

For Scientific Linux See [R 2]

For Ubuntu See [R 4]

For Debian See [R 5]




Mitigation
==========

N/A.


Component installation information
==================================

Red Hat see [R 3]

Scientific Linux See [R 2]

Ubuntu See [R 4]

Debian See [R 5]



Recommendations
===============

While SVG is not aware of any exploit at present, it is potentially serious if
an exploit were to become available which worked in the EGI infrastructure.
There is then the  possibility that this may escalate to become a  'Critical'
risk issue.  Hence it is recommended that sites update their systems when it is
convenient to do so.
