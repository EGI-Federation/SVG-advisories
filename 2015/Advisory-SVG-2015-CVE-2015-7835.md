Introduction
============

Xen is an open source Virtualization platform [R 1] and is used primarily for
Cloud virtualization, including by some EGI Cloud Resource Providers.

Xen issued several advisories on 29th October 2015. [R 2]

One of these SVG considers serious, CVE-2015-7835 [R 3].

In the case when a user inside a Virtual Machine has 'root' access to that
Virtual Machine it allows a user to 'breakout' of the Virtual Machine.   In EGI
this is mainly relevant to EGI Federated Cloud sites where users generally do
have root access inside the Virtual machine, which use Xen as their
virtualization technology.


Details
=======

This is serious as it allows a user with root access to a VM to escape to the
VM to the 'dom0' and get root there, and easily affect all VMs running on that
system.  The access complexity is also stated as 'Low' which SVG takes into
account during risk assessment.

Sites should see [R 3], [R 4], and [R 5].

Details of the bug itself are at [R 6] where it is also described as a
'Critical' bug.


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'Critical' risk by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment
Team.


Affected software
=================

Xen if users are allowed root inside the Virtual Machine.

Generally applicable to the EGI Federated Cloud if Xen is used as the
virtualization technology.


Mitigation
==========

See the Xen Advisory [R 3]


Component installation information
==================================

See the Xen Advisory [R 3]


Recommendations
===============

All running resources deploying Xen MUST be either patched or have mitigation
in place by 2015-11-10  T21:00+01:00.

Sites failing to act and/or failing to respond to requests from the EGI CSIRT
team risk site suspension.
