Short Alert
===========

Ceph is a distributed storage solution and is used in some sites in the EGI
infrastructure.

A security notice has been issued by Ceph regarding singing key and binary
downloads of Ceph.

Sites running Ceph should check the following link:

http://ceph.com/releases/important-security-notice-regarding-signing-key-and-binary-downloads-of-ceph/

and check which version they have and that it is signed appropriately if they
have not done so already.

It is difficult to find whether any EGI sites are affected by this security
issue, or the risk if any have been so we leave it to sites to check.
