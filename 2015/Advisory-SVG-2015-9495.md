Other Information
==================


**Original statement**

To give sites time to upgrade their dCache, the dCache team will not release
any details of the vulnerability at this time.  This includes not making
public the source-code for the fix for a 'grace period' of two weeks, as doing
so would also reveal information on the vulnerability.

During this two week grace period, dCache will make no further releases.

Once the grace-period elapses, all code changes will be pushed into github and
dCache will continue normal bug-fix release cycles.

**UPDATE**

A fixed version is now available in the EGI UMD

**UPDATE 2015-10-26 **

The advisory is public, the fix has been in the UMD for over 3 weeks, so info
on details of the vulnerability may become public.


Recommendations
===============

Sites are recommended to update the SRM head node component as soon as possible
if they have not done so already.
