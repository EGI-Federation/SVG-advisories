Title:   EGI SVG Advisory 'Moderate' risk - Openldap remote DoS vulnerability -
         CVE-2015-6908

Date:    2015-10-06
Updated: 2016-07-27

URL:     https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/Advisory-SVG-2015-CVE-2015-6908

Introduction
============

**Originally**

A vulnerability exists in OpenLDAP which allows unauthenticated remote DoS,
and an exploit is publicly available.

BDII, which is used to find information on deployed services in the Grid,
is dependent on OpenLDAP.

However, the latest version of OpenLDAP does not work reliably with BDII.

**UPDATE** The version of OpenLDAP available with RedHat 6.8 should work with
BDII and solve the vulnerability issue.  This is now available in Scientific
Linux 6.8 and CentOS too.

Details
=======

Previously:--

For more information see [R 1] and [R 2]

The public exploit has been sucessfully tested by the reporter of this issue,
and the EGI  Grid infrastructure may be seen as vulnerable to a trivial remote
DoS attack. It is fairly easy to attack a site and bring down services.

However, it's easy to detect that the service has crashed and restart it, and
given suitable logs it should be easy to see where the attacks are coming from
and block them using a firewall.

The latest version of OpenLDAP in some cases crashes under high load, and
doesn't work reliably with BDII. Hence upgrading may impact service without the
service being attacked, so upgrade is not recommended at present as described
in [R 3]

**UPDATE**:-

The version of OpenLDAP available with RedHat 6.8 should work with BDII and
solve the vulnerability issue.  This is now available in Scientific Linux 6.8
and CentOS too.


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'Moderate'  risk by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment
Team.


Affected software
=================

This is fully resolved in version openldap-2.4.40-12.el6 for RedHat6 and
derivatives, both in terms of not being vulnerable, and working efficiently
with BDII.


Mitigation
==========

Sites should check their logs if services related to OpenLDAP, BDII apear to
crash for no reason.

Component installation information
==================================

Updated:--

openldap version fixing the vulnerability in SL6 AND which works reliably with
BDII is openldap-2.4.40-12.el6

This is available in RedHat 6.8 and its derivatives.

Note that the bdii service needs to be restarted after updating openldap


Recommendations
===============

Previously:--

At this time there is no openldap version that has the fix _and_ works reliably
for the BDII.

Sites are recommended to keep using the last stable version for resource, site
and top BDII services.

If sites find that BDII is crashing, and they have not upgraded OpenLDAP they
should investigate their logs to see if there is a possible incident.

UPDATE:--

This is fully resolved if sites upgrade to RedHat 6.8 or derivatives, so sites
should update to a suitable version when it is convenient if they have not done
so already.



Other Information
==================

This issue is DoS, and DoS are normally rated as 'Low' risk.

However, given that a publicly available exploit is available which does not
require authentication in this case we have assessed it as 'Moderate' risk, due
to the potential impact on the availability of the infrastructure.


Previous statement:--

This is also being distributed as 'Amber', when normally a Moderate risk
vulnerability would be distributed as 'White', to avoid drawing attention to
the fact that this issue exists in EGI andis not resolved.

**UPDATE**

The issue is now resolved in the version of OpenLDAP with RedHat Version 6.8
which is also available in Scientific Linux 6.8 and CentOS
