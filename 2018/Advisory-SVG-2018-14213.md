Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] 'CRITICAL' risk.
         Singularity can be tricked to create directories and files outside the
         container.


Date:    2018-03-29
Updated: 2018-05-23 - [TLP:WHITE] and fixed in later versions.


Affected software and risk
========================

'CRITICAL' risk vulnerability concerning singularity

Package : Singularity
CVE ID  : Not assigned yet

A vulnerability has been reported where Singularity can create arbitrary
directories and files outside the container.  If Singularity is deployed setuid
root, such files and directories can be created anywhere and with root
ownership.  Existing files cannot be overwritten, though.

At least all versions from 2.4.2 onwards are affected, this includes the latest
versions recommended by WLCG and OSG.

Actions required/recommended
============================

**UPDATE 2018-05-23**

This is fixed in version 2.5.0, which also fixes another critical
vulnerability:--
https://advisories.egi.eu/2018/Advisory-SVG-2018-14311


Mitigation
==========

Sites running singularity are urged to disable OverlayFS by replacing the
`enable overlay` setting in `/etc/singularity/singularity.conf` to read `enable
overlay = no`.


Further information
==================

The mitigation will effectively disable all creation of mount points for bound
directories and files in the container, so anything you intend to bind into the
image needs pre-created mountpoints in the image.

It is thought that this mitigation does not affect the way singularity is used
by CMS.

As soon as a patched version is available, this advisory will be updated.
