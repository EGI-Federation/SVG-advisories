Title:   EGI SVG 'ALERT'[TLP:WHITE] Docker symlink-race attack CVE-2018-15664
         CVE [EGI-SVG-CVE-2018-15664]

Date:    2019-05-29
Updated: 2019-09-16  Redhat released a fix in July


Affected software and risk
==========================

Vulnerability concerning Docker

Package : Docker
CVE ID  : CVE-2018-15644

Docker has been found to be vulnerable to a symlink-race attack.   Some
information on this has been released publicly [R 1] [R 2] but SVG is still
investigating the implications.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites or anyone in the EGI community running Docker should be ready to patch or
take other mitigating action when a patch or mitigation is available.

Sites failing to act and/or failing to respond to requests from the EGI CSIRT
team risk site suspension.

Component installation information
==================================

**UPDATE**

RedHat has produced a fix, see [R 4]

For ubuntu information  see [R 5]

For Debian see [R 6]

Mitigation
==========

None defined yet.

More information
================

See [R 1], [R 2]

SVG will provide an update when action is recommended.

SVG has assessed the potential impact of the vulnerability and concluded that
affected hosts would be vulnerable only if they allow unprivileged users to
launch their own containers through a Docker service.
That is, Worker Nodes that happen to be Docker containers themselves would, for
example, not be vulnerable.

Although investigations are still ongoing, given the public attention for this
issue we are sending this Alert.

**UPDATE 2019-09-16 ** Issue fixed, advisory updated.

purpose "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software
vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 3] in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be
correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on
how the software is used.
