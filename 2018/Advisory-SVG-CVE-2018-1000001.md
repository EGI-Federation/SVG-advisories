Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] Up to 'CRITICAL' risk glibc
         vulnerability CVE-2018-1000001 [EGI-SVG-CVE-2018-1000001]

Date:    2018-03-26
Updated: 2018-05-24

Affected software and risk
==========================

Up to CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning glibc

Package : glibc
CVE ID  : CVE-2018-1000001

In glibc 2.26 and earlier there is confusion in the usage of getcwd() by
realpath() which can be used to write before the destination buffer leading to
a buffer underflow and potential code execution.  [R 1] [R 2]

For Ubuntu and Debian, there is a public exploit, [R 3] resulting in privilege
escalation to root.
The exploit needs adaptation to work under RHEL-based systems.

The exploit works primarily for hosts with unprivileged user name spaces
enabled, e.g. for use with singularity in non-setuid mode or docker.

Actions required/recommended
============================

**UPDATE 2018-05-24 **

Patches are now available for most relevant linux versions.

Sites typically should apply updates as soon as is convenient.

Sites with unprivileged user name spaces enabled should either apply the
relevant updates urgently, or apply the mitigation described below.

Affected software details
=========================

Affected: glibc 2.26 and earlier.

Fixed: glibc 2.27 [R 4].

More information
================

See [R 1], [R 2], [R 3], [R 4], [R 5], [R 7]

Mitigation
==========

Any site running singularity in non-setuid mode should consider changing to
setuid mode.
Similarly, sites using docker should consider running with unprivileged user
name spaces disabled.

Component installation information
==================================

**UPDATE 2018-05-24** - more versions of linux contain a fixed version of glibc

For RedHat Enterprise linux 7 see [R 5]

For Scientific Linux SL7 see [R 6]

For CentOS see [R 7]

**UPDATE 2018-05-24 after e-mail sent Correction**

Fixed in CentOS 7.5 released on 10th May.

For Ubuntu see [R 8]

For Debian see [R 9]
