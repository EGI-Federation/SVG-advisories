Affected software and risk
==========================

HIGH risk vulnerabilities concerning Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS)
affecting Intel microprocessors

Package : Linux kernel/Chip design
CVE ID  :  CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130, and CVE-2019-11091

Intel released a statement regarding Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS), a
new set of hardware-level security vulnerabilities affecting microprocessors
related to the way that microprocessor chips cache memory have been disclosed.
This allows privilege escalation and unauthorized access to user data. [R 1] [R
2]

Updated versions of the /intel-microcode/, /qemu, xen/ and /linux/ kernel
packages are being published.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites should apply vendor kernel updates as soon as possible.


Component installation information
==================================

For RedHat see [R 5]

For Scientific Linux see [R 6]  (patch not available yet)

For CentoS see [R 7]

For Ubuntu see [R 8]

For Debian see [R 9]

The CERN Computer Security team have provided further information, some of
which could be useful also to other sites.  See [R 13]

More information, especially concerning hypervisors, may be added later.


More information
================

See [R 10], [R 11] for detailed explanations of these vulnerabilities.

As far as the EGI SVG is aware, this only affects Intel Processors.

Context
=======

This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's
purpose "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software
vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 10]  in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be
correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on
how the software is used.

Others may re-use this information provided they:-

1) Respect the provided TLP classification

2) Credit the EGI https://www.egi.eu/ Software Vulnerability Group

Note that the SVG issue handling procedure is currently under review, to take
account of the increasing inhomogeneity of the EGI infrastructure and the
services in the EOSC-hub catalogue.

On behalf of the EGI SVG,
