Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning Singularity

Package : Singularity
CVE ID  : CVE-2018-12021

A vulnerability has been found concerning installations of singularity which
support overlayfs, which is the default for RedHat Enterprise linux 7 and its
derivatives (e.g. SL7) [R 1].

The vulnerability allows a malicious user to escalate privileges and access
protected files.

Actions required/recommended
============================

**UPDATE 2018-07-08**

The updated version of the singularity RPM (2.5.2) is now available in the EPEL
repository.  Sites should update, urgently if they have not already carried out
the mitigation below.

All running resources MUST be either patched or have mitigation in place or
software removed by 2018-07-16  00:00 UTC.

Sites failing to act and/or failing to respond to requests from the EGI CSIRT
team risk site suspension.


Affected software details
=========================

This vulnerability has been fixed in Singularity version 2.5.2

All versions of Singularity including and prior to 2.5.1 are affected.

This vulnerability affects sites running Singularity with RedHat Enterprise
linux 7 and its derivatives.

Sites running Singularity with RedHat Enterprise linux 6 and its derivatives
are not vulnerable.

Mitigation
==========

Sites running singularity along with RedHat 7 and its derivatives must disable
OverlayFS by replacing the `enable overlay` setting in
`/etc/singularity/singularity.conf` to read `enable overlay = no`.

This was recommended to mitigate a previous singularity vulnerability [R 2],
therefore some sites may already have mitigation in place.

The previous version in EPEL, does NOT have overlay_fs disabled by default
therefore all sites should ensure that overlay_fs is disabled.


More information
================

Information on this vulnerability has been released publicly [R 1].

**UPDATE 2018-07-09**

The fixed version, 2.5.2 is now in EPEL production repository.
Sites are recommended to update as soon as possible, urgently if they do not
have the mitigation in place.

Component installation information
==================================

The rpm patch has been released in EPEL production repository.
