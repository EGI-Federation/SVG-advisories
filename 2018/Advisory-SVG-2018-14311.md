Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY’ [TLP:WHITE] ‘CRITICAL’ risk. Local privilege
         escalation using singularity [EGI-SVG-2018-14311]

Date:    2018-04-30
Updated: 2018-05-21 **changed to TLP:WHITE and placed on wiki**

Affected software and risk
==========================

'CRITICAL' risk vulnerability concerning singularity

Package : Singularity
CVE ID  : Not assigned yet

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported concerning Singularity, where for
example Singularity can create arbitrary directories and files outside the
container.
If Singularity is deployed setuid root (the _default_ configuration), such
files and directories can be created anywhere and with root ownership, which
implies a trivial local root exploit and hence affects any user on the same
host.

At least all versions from 2.4.2 and prior to 2.5.0 are affected.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are strongly requested to do **one** of the following:
- update to 2.5.0-1.1, released in the WLCG repository at 15:45 CEST on April
  30th
- remove the singularity and singularity-runtime packages
- disable the setuid-bit of all the singularity binaries which will effectively
  disable singularity on most deployments:

```chmod u-s /usr/libexec/singularity/bin/*-suid```

Mitigation
==========

There is no known mitigation other than updating, removing or disabling
Singularity.


Additional information
====================

As CMS strongly relies on singularity, disabling singularity can strongly
affect CMS workflows.

Please note that two issues have already been found in singularity 2.5.0, which
may affect certain workflows:
- Incompatibility with NFS (root_squash):
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/1491
- Incompatibility with SSSD:
https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/pull/1490
