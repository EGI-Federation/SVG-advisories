Affected software and risk
==========================

HIGH risk vulnerability concerning Singularity

Package : Singularity
CVE ID  : N/A

There is a vulnerability in Singularity allowing processes to escape from the
container.
They then would have access to parts of the host file systems that were assumed
to be shielded.

**NOTE** This is a separate issue from our "ALERT - image mounting via
Singularity [EGI-SVG-2018-13999]" which is also being sent to sites to
recommend configuration checks/changes for all versions of singularity.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running singularity-2.3.2 should update to singularity-2.4.2 as soon as
possible.

It is available from the WLCG rpm repository [R 1].


Affected software details
=========================

Singularity 2.3.2

Earlier and later versions of Singularity are not affected.


More information
================

Note that there are some command line incompatibilities with version 2.3.2,
mostly in the commands related to managing images.


Component installation information
==================================

On hosts where the singularity rpm is installed, a simple rpm update should
normally be sufficient.

If the original configuration file was modified, it may have to be adjusted
after the update.
