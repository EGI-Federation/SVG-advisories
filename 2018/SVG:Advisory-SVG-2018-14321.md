Title:       EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] LOW risk CREAM command injection attack [EGI-SVG-2018-14321]

Date:        2019-11-27
Updated:

Affected software and risk
==========================

LOW risk vulnerability concerning CREAM

Package : CREAM

A 'LOW' risk vulnerability was found which may make CREAM vulnerable to a DoS attack.

Actions required/recommended
============================

This vulnerability was fixed over a year ago, so most sites will already be running a non-vulnerable
version of CREAM, so will not need to take action.
Sites running CREAM should check that they are running a version of CREAM which is not vulnerable.

Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites is
repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD).

Sites using the EGI UMD 4 should see:

http://repository.egi.eu/category/umd_releases/distribution/umd-4/


Affected software details
=========================

The fixed version is in [R 1].  This contains the list of components which constitute the version where
 the software was fixed.


More information
================

After checking through old tickets it was found that this issue had been fixed some time ago and SVG
was not aware of it.

As this is old and 'LOW' risk this advisory is being placed on the Wiki for completeness, without
 sending to sites.

The vulnerability was not mentioned in the release notes for the version of CREAM in which it was fixed  [R 1]

We note that CREAM is being phased out.


TLP and URL
===========

** WHITE information - Unlimited distribution
  - see https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_CSIRT:TLP for distribution restrictions***

Context
=======

This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's purpose
"To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling procedure [R 2]
in the context of how the software is used in the EGI infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group,
we do not guarantee it to be correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments
depending on how the software is used.

Others may re-use this information provided they:-

1) Respect the provided TLP classification

2) Credit the EGI https://www.egi.eu/ Software Vulnerability Group

Note that the SVG issue handling procedure is currently under review, to take account of the
increasing inhomogeneity of the EGI infrastructure and the services in the EOSC-hub catalogue.
