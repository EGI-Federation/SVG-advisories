EGI CSIRT ADVISORY [EGI-ADV-20101102]

Title:       High Risk Vulnerability CVE-2010-3865 kernel: integer overflow rds
[EGI-ADV-20101102]
Date:        November 03, 2010
Last update: November 03, 2010

Introduction
============

Another problem in the rds module has been detected, with the
potential of giving any local user root privileges. This vulnerability
has been labelled CVE-2010-3865.

This is a separate issue from the recent CVE-2010-3904 vulnerability
in rds, and the kernel update fixing CVE-2010-3904 does not fix
CVE-2010-3865.

This vulnerability affects RHEL5 and its derivatives, and any system
that has installed the third-party OFED stack for Infiniband
communication.

No public exploit for this issue is currently known, but the EGI CSIRT
considers this to be a high risk vulnerability.


Details
=======

As reported by Thomas Pollet, when doing rdma I/O, the rds module's
page counter can overflow, since the total number of pages may not fit
in an unsigned int.

It may be possible to exploit this issue to get unauthorized access to
kernel memory, which in turn can be used to get elevated privileges.


Mitigation
==========

Most systems do not utilize RDS and can simply block the vulnerability
by blacklisting the RDS module (after unloading it if it is present),
for instance by running this script:

------------------

#!/bin/sh

# Unload the module

if lsmod | grep -q '^rds '; then
  echo "RDS was loaded"
fi
rmmod rds 2>/dev/null
if lsmod | grep -q '^rds '; then
  echo "FAILED to unload RDS"
fi

# Blacklist the module
echo "install rds /bin/true" > /etc/modprobe.d/disable-rds
echo "alias net-pf-28 off" >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-rds"

------------------

This will take effect immediately and does not require a reboot. The
blacklisting will stay persistent across reboots.

Please note that some clusters with Infiniband may actually use RDS.
In these cases, the only solution is to deploy a patched kernel.


Recommendations
===============

Immediately apply the mitigation described above to all
user-accessible systems.

Apply vendor kernel updates when they become available.

Since the rds module seems to have more problems it is recommended to
keep this module blacklisted if not needed at your site, even after
updating the kernel.
