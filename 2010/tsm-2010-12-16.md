EGI CSIRT ADVISORY [EGI-ADV-2010-12-16]

Title:       HIGH root vulnerabilities in Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) client software [EGI-ADV-20101216] TLP:WHITE
Date:        2010-12-16

URL:         https://advisories.egi.eu/CSIRT_Alerts/tsm-2010-12-16


Introduction
============

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) client software.
This is a HIGH risk for the EGI infrastructure as a whole, but is CRITICAL for sites running the vulnerable software.

A patch is available from the vendor (see link below).


Details
=======

One of the vulnerabilities would allow unauthorized users with network access to execute commands.
The commands could, for example, allow the attacker to read, copy, alter, or delete files on the client machine.

The other vulnerabilities would allow a local user to read, copy, alter, or delete files, or to
replace system files on the client with arbitrary content.


Risk Category
=============

This issue has been assessed as HIGH by the EGI CSIRT for the EGI infrastructure as a whole
but is CRITICAL for sites running the vulnerable software.


Affected Software
=================

IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM). RedHat packages are named TIVsm-*.

For each release, the vendor has provided the version numbers for vulnerable and fixed patch levels.

Release    Vulnerable versions        Fixed version
TSM 6.2    6.2.0.0 through 6.2.1.1    6.2.2
TSM 6.1    6.1.0.0 through 6.1.3.4    6.1.4
TSM 5.5    5.5.0.0 through 5.5.2.12   5.5.3
TSM 5.4    5.4.0.0 through 5.4.3.3    5.4.3.4

Mitigation
==========

To mitigate the local user vulnerabilities sites may delete or remove the SUID bit from the dsmtca binary:

rm /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsmtca

This will block local users from running the backup / archive client, but root-initiated backups should continue to work.

At this time, we do not have a confirmed mitigation for the more serious remote user vulnerability.


Component Installation information
==================================

Fixes and instructions are available from IBM, linked from the Alert at
http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21454745&myns=swgtiv&mynp=OCSSGSG7&mync=E

Recommendations
===============

Sites running IBM Tivoli Storage Manager should check if they are running a vulnerable version.

These sites should immediately apply the vendor patches.

If it is not possible to apply patches immediately, sites should evaluate the proposed mitigation.

Credit
======

This vulnerability was reported by IBM and Kryptos Logic.
