## Meltdown and Spectre Vulnerabilities

### Purpose of this page

To provide more detailed information about the Meltdown and Spectre
vulnerabilities, to complement the advisory,
[SVG:Advisory-SVG-CVE-2017-5753](./2017/Advisory-SVG-CVE-2017-5753.md).

This was compiled in January and early February 2018

Information including more recent
[SVG Speculative execution vulnerabilities](./Speculative_Execution_Vulnerabilities.md)

### What are they?

These are vulnerabilities in the design of the chip hardware, and cannot be
fully resolved by patching operating systems. However patches are available
which mitigate these problems.

- Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) affects most Intel chips.
- Spectre (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715) affects a wide range of chips.

For more details, see [Meltdown attack](https://meltdownattack.com/),
[Spectre attack](https://spectreattack.com/) and
[Project zero: Reading privileged memory with side](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.dk/2018/01/reading-privileged-memory-with-side.html)

### How to mitigate these vulnerabilities

Each CVE can be mitigated via different ways:

- Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) can be mitigated via
  [Kernel Page Table Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_page-table_isolation),
  which is enabled by default in latest linux kernels
- Spectre Variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753) has to be mitigated in each software which
  can be vulnerable. The latest linux kernel contains fixes to protect itself
  (does not protect other software).
- Spectre Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715) can be (at least partially) mitigated via at
  least two different approach:
  - Using new Intel-specific MSR, added via a microcode update, to control
    indirect branch restricted speculation (IBRS): Both a kernel and a microcode
    update are required. In addition, in case of virtualization, an update of
    the virtualization software (e.g. qemu & virt) is required to expose the new
    MSR to the VM.
  - Using "retpoline", a new software construct that can mitigate, on most CPUs,
    the vulnerability

#### RedHat

As of Feb 2nd 2018, RedHat has offered new kernel updates that can mitigate
Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754), Spectre Variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753) and Spectre Variant
2 (CVE-2017-5715), see their page on
[Speculative Execution](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/speculativeexecution).

However, due to instability issues, it has
[removed the microcode updates required for Spectre Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715)](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0093).
Until Intel releases stable microcode or RedHat switches to 'retpoline', no
mitigation for Spectre Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715) is safely usable.

It is currently possible to mitigate Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) and Spectre
Variant 1 (CVE-2017-5753) by:

- On RHEL7: Updating the kernel to 3.10.0-693.11.6.el7, see
  [RHSA-2018:0007](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0007)
- On RHEL6: Updating the kernel to 2.6.32-696.18.7.el6, see
  [RHSA-2018:0008](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:0008)

#### Centos

Centos is following RedHat (see above).

It is currently possible to mitigate Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) and Spectre

### More Information

#### Relevant Advisories

##### CERN

CERN has compiled information which is useful for many EGI sites:

- [CERN: spectre - meltdown](https://security.web.cern.ch/security/advisories/spectre-meltdown/spectre-meltdown.shtml)

##### Intel

Intel has initially, on January 8th,
[released new microcodes](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27431/Linux-Processor-Microcode-Data-File)
to complement the IBRS kernel patchset. However, these new microcodes are in
fact **unstable** and Intel has since then recommended to stop deploying them.

Intel latest recommendation can be found in their advisory,
[INTEL-SA-00088](https://security-center.intel.com/advisory.aspx?intelid=INTEL-SA-00088&languageid=en-fr)
