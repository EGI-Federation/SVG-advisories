Title:   EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] Up to 'High' risk - Singularity container
         escape vulnerability [EGI-SVG-2017-12381]

Date:    2017-02-17
Updated:


Affected software and risk
==========================

Up to HIGH risk vulnerability concerning Singularity container escape.

Package : Singularity
CVE ID  : N/A
Bug ID  : N/A

If unprivileged users are allowed to launch their own containers through
Singularity, it would be possible for a malicious user to create and manipulate
specifically crafted raw devices within containers they own, and then gain
access outside their own container.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running Singularity must update as soon as possible.


Affected software details
=========================

This is fixed in Singularity Version 2.2.1

Earlier versions are vulnerable.


More information
================

See [R 1]

We rate this as 'up to High risk' as the actual risk depends on the type of use
and local site configuration.

When singularity containers are run via batch systems, which we think is likely
to be a typical implementation in EGI, the vulnerability cannot be exploited.

The configurations that allow individual users to upload and execute
singularity containers are vulnerable and must be updated urgently.


Component installation information
==================================

Fixed version is available from [R 1]

TLP and URL
