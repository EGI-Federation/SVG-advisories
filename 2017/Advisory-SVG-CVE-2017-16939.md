Title:   EGI SVG 'ALERT' [TLP:WHITE] linux kernel 'use-after-free' flaw in XFRM
         [EGI-SVG-CVE-2017-16939]

Date:    2018-02-23
Updated: 2018-03-19 changed to [TLP:WHITE}
         2018-05-16 fixed for RedHat 7 and its derivatives


Affected software and risk
==========================

Vulnerability concerning Linux kernel XFRM for sites having unprivileged user
namespaces enabled.

Package : Linux Kernel
CVE ID  : CVE-2017-16939
Bug ID  :

NOTE: Only applicable for sites having unprivileged user namespaces enabled.

A vulnerability has been found in the Linux kernel concerning XFRM.
A 'use-after-free' flaw has been found which may in some circumstances lead to
privilege escalation. [R 1], [R 2], [R 3]  If unprivileged user namespaces are
used on a service to which users have shell access (e.g. worker nodes
supporting fully unprivileged creation of containers), then the vulnerability
would be exploitable there.
This is most likely to be significant in EGI in relation to usage of
Singularity [R 4].

Actions required/recommended
============================

RedHat 7 and its derivatives: kernel update is NOT yet available, but
vulnerable sites should urgently, as mitigation, disable at least user _net_
namespaces [R 10]:

    root@host # echo "user.max_net_namespaces = 0" > /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_net_namespaces.conf
    root@host # sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_net_namespaces.conf

Note: network namespaces are an essential aspect to many Docker (and other
container runtime) deployments, and the site may have to choose between safely
running unprivileged Singularity and using the default Docker configuration.
Docker can avoid network namespaces by passing the `--net=host` option to its
command line clients.

RedHat 6 and its derivatives: not affected.

For Debian or Ubuntu: fixed via the kernel update for Meltdown/Spectre
vulnerabilities.

If anyone becomes aware of any situation where this vulnerability has a
significant impact on the EGI infrastructure then please inform EGI SVG.
