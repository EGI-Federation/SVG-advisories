Date:    2018-01-03

**UPDATED 2018-01-23**: Deadline for CVE-2017-5754 & CVE-2017-5753 mitigation

Affected software and risk
==========================

'CRITICAL' risk vulnerabilities concerning processors in common usage,
including  Intel.

Package : Intel and other processors
CVE ID  : CVE-2017-5754 - Meltdown(Variant 3) -  Only affects Intel chips.
        : CVE-2017-5753 - Spectre(Variant 1) - Affects wide range of chips
        : CVE-2017-5715 - Spectre(Variant 2) - Affects wide range of chips


Actions required/recommended
============================

This advisory is under constant revision, links to detailed public information
and patches are being published on the EGI SVG wiki at [R 1] as soon as they
are available to us. Please check frequently.

Meltdown(Variant 3) and Spectre(Variant 1): All sites MUST update their kernel
and reboot before 9am (CET) Tuesday morning next week (30th January),
2018/01/30T09:00:00+01:00.
Priority should be given to services with direct user access, like
ssh-gateways, user interfaces (UIs), VOBoxs, WorkerNodes (WNs).
Failure to update within this time-frame will be followed-up as per our
Critical Vulnerability Handling [R 3].

Spectre(Variant 2): Given the instabilities reported by Intel on its own
microcode [R 4] and RedHat removing said microcodes from its packages, there
is currently no known and simple supported mitigation for this vulnerabilty.
Sites are encouraged to follow closely updates from their software and
hardware vendors, who might be releasing specific updates.
