Title:   EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] 'HIGH' risk - Stack clash memory
         allocation vulnerability  CVE-2017-1000364  [EGI-SVG-CVE-2017-1000364]

Date:    2017-06-21 (Heads up)
Updated: 2017-07-11


Affected software and risk
==========================

'HIGH' risk vulnerability concerning the linux kernel and glibc

Package : Linux Kernel, glibc
CVE ID  : CVE-2017-1000364, CVE-2017-1000366

A memory allocation vulnerability has been found which may allow an authorized
user to gain root privileges. [R 1] [R 2] [R 3] [R 4] [R 5] [R 6].

For the EGI infrastructure this affects Worker Nodes (WNs), shared User
interface (UI) instances, and in the EGI Federated cloud Virtual Machines (VMs)
which distinguish between privileged and unprivileged users.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update as soon as possible, if they have not done so
already.

For sites using 32 bit machines, update is urgent as the vulnerability is
'Critical' in this case.

For the kernel updates, it should be noted that updating requires a re-boot.

In the 'Heads up' on 2017-06-21 We did not recommend action, as there appeared
to be problems with the updates.  See [R 7] [R 8] [R 9].


Affected software details
=========================

All versions of Linux are affected.

Exploit is much more difficult / time consuming on 64bit than on 32bit.
If 32 bit machines are still in use sites should take action more urgently.

More information
================


For more information see [R 10]

There were reported problems with Java Virtual Machine (JVM), on which some
software used in EGI depends [R 12].
We understand this is now resolved with the latest versions of linux.


TLP and URL
===========

** WHITE information - Unlimited distribution -
see https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_CSIRT:TLP for distribution restrictions***

Context
=======

This 'heads up' has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's
purpose "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software
vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 11] in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be
correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on
how the software is used.

Others may re-use this information provided they:-

1) Respect the provided TLP classification
