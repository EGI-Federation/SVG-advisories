Date:        2017-11-01
Updated:     2017-11-03

Affected software and risk
==========================

Vulnerabilities have been reported concerning Tomcat remote execution in
non-standard configurations.

Package : Tomcat
CVE ID  : CVE-2017-12615, CVE-2017-12617

Remote execution vulnerabilities have been reported concerning Tomcat, however
in most configurations they are unlikely to be exploitable.  [R 1] [R 2] [R 3]
[R 4]

If any site or Virtual Appliance (VM image) endorser is aware that any of these
or other tomcat vulnerabilities presents a serious problem to EGI, please
inform the EGI SVG.

This alert is being sent to the VO managers and VO security contacts via the
EGI broadcast tool, as well as the usual contacts.

Actions required/recommended
============================

For Grid sites, no action is necessary.

There is the possibility that for some FedCloud applications/Virtual Machines
(VMs) using Tomcat, that insecure configurations may exist, although SVG is not
aware of any.
If any site or Virtual Appliance (VM image) endorser is aware that any of these
or other tomcat vulnerabilities presents a serious problem to EGI, please
inform the EGI SVG.

Affected software details
=========================

Various versions of tomcat are vulnerable - See [R 3] - [R 9]

More information
================

If "readonly" is set to 'TRUE' which is the default in RedHat, these
vulnerabilities are not exploitable.
EGI Grid Middleware using tomcat has been checked by SVG members, and no
exploitable usage of tomcat has been found.

It is possible that exploitable configurations exist in the EGI Federated
Cloud.
Anyone developing FedCloud Virtual Appliances (VM images) which use tomcat
should check that they are not vulnerable and if they are take appropriate
action and inform EGI SVG.
