Title:   EGI SVG ADVISORY [TLP:WHITE] Up to 'HIGH' risk dnsmasq multiple
         vulnerabilities [EGI-SVG-CVE-2017-14491]

Date:    2017-10-05
Updated:

Affected software and risk
==========================

Up to HIGH risk - multiple vulnerabilities concerning dnsmasq have been found
by Google [R 1]

Package : dnsmasq
CVE ID  : CVE-2017-14491 and several more - for list see [R 2]
Bug ID  :

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in dnsmasq, the most important being
CVE-2017-14491.
By carefully constructing DNS requests and responses, dnsmasq could be made to
overflow an internal buffer on the heap, using content influenced by the
attacker.  This could potentially be used to achieve code execution. This is
only relevant in scenarios where the dnsmasq is facing end-users.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running dnsmasq are recommended to update relevant components as soon as
possible.

Sites should be aware that if a public exploit is released which allows easy
exploitation this is likely to be elevated to 'Critical'.   In this case sites
will then be required to patch within 7 days or risk suspension.

=========================

Affected software details

dnsmasq 2.77 and earlier.

More information
================

Patches for these vulnerabilities have been made available in all linux
distributions, prior to the vulnerabilities being made public.
