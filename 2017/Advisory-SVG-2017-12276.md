Title:   EGI SVG Advisory 'HIGH' risk canl-c impersonation vulnerability
         [EGI-SVG-2017-12276]

Date:    2017-03-24
Updated: 2017-06-01 - Changed to 'WHITE'


Affected software and risk
==========================

'HIGH' risk impersonation vulnerability concerning canl-c.

Package : canl-c
CVE ID  : N/A

A vulnerability has been found which may allow a user to impersonate another
user where it is hard to trace the origin.
This is present in all recent versions of canl-c.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running services depending on canl-c should update as soon as possible.

Please ensure all potentially affected services are restarted after the update.
In particular for the DPM, FTS, and LFC:

     service httpd restart

Affected software details
=========================

This is fixed in canl-c version 2.1.8-1. Earlier versions are all likely to be
affected.

Affected software particularly includes anything which uses canl-c via
GridSite:

    DPM

    LFC

    FTS - but only in limited circumstances.

    WMS - ditto

CREAM also uses gridsite and canl-c, but happens not to be vulnerable.


More information
================

This exploit has been demonstrated to exist by the reporter.

The mitigating circumstances are that the issue is difficult to find, there is
no public information on it, and the exploit requires a valid certificate from
a trusted CA.

If information on how to exploit this were to become public, then it will be
raised to 'Critical'.

Mitigation
