Title:   EGI SVG Advisory/Alert [TLP:WHITE] Attacks on Hadoop installations
         - sites should check they are securely configured [EGI-SVG-2017-12391]

Date:    2017-02-13
Updated:


Affected software and risk
==========================

Attacks are being carried out on Hadoop installations which are not securely
configured.

Package : Hadoop
CVE ID  : N/A
Bug ID  : N/A

The OSG Security team has received a report of "drive-by" attacks on various
open source products, including Hadoop.  Attackers are looking for unsecured
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) instances where they can perform
unauthorized malicious activities, such as modify or delete all accessible data
at the site.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running Hadoop should check that their sites are securely configured.

(Based on alert from OSG)

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

- Ensure that Hadoop instances, and all services, are kept up to date with the
  latest supported software versions.

- Remove off-site access from the Hadoop end-points: NameNodes, Backup
  NameNodes and Secondary NameNodes.

- Make sure the Hadoop end-points at your site are only accessible from the
  services that need access.


See Apache hadoop HDFS Permissions Guide [R 1]
