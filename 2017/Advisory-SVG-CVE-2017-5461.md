Affected software and risk
==========================

HIGH risk vulnerability concerning NSS out of bounds write flaw

Package : NSS
CVE ID  : CVE-2017-5461

Potentially it is possible to carry out unauthenticated remote code execution,
although it is likely to be difficult to exploit.

Any secure grid service (CE, SE, Argus, FTS, ...) may be affected.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update relevant components and restart affected
services if they have not done so already.


Affected software details
=========================

See [R 2], [R 3]


More information
================

See [R 1]

Note that if an exploit were to become available which allows this
vulnerability to be exploited in the EGI environment then the risk will be
elevated to 'Critical'


Component installation information
==================================

Sites running Scientific Linux should see [ R 2]

(Note that this was fixed in Scientific Linux on 20th April 2017, so sites
which have updated since this date and restarted affected services do not need
to take any action.)

Sites running RedHat should see [R 3]

Sites running CentOS should see [R 4]

Some services may need to be re-started.

Where possible it is suggested that sites re-boot after installing the updates.

If this is not possible, Site admins MUST check for ALL services that are still
using the libnss libraries, e.g. using

   needs-restarting

(when available via yum-utils)

or this oneliner:
    grep -l 'libnss.*deleted' /proc/*/maps | tr -cd 0-9\\n | xargs -r ps u
