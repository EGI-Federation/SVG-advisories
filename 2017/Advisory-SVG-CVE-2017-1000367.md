Title:   EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] 'Moderate' risk - sudo local root
         vulnerability CVE-2017-1000367 [EGI-SVG-CVE-2017-1000367]

Affected software and risk
==========================

Vulnerability concerning sudo.

Package : sudo
CVE ID  : CVE-2017-1000367

Privilege escalation vulnerability in sudo via improper get_process_ttyname()
parsing.
Although sudo is used in the CREAM-CE, it is under normal circumstances not
exploitable by itself in a properly configured site.
We are not aware of any other Grid-related uses of sudo that would be exploitable.
See [R 1]


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update relevant components as soon as it is
convenient.

Sites should verify that they don't run an exploitable configuration of sudo
(i.e. run sudo with a sudoers file that limits for example the list of allowed
commands or only allows running as non-root users).


Affected software details
=========================

See [R 2], [R 3], [R 4], [R 5]

More information
================

See [R 1], [R 2], [R 3], [R 4], [R 5]


Component installation information
==================================

Sites should see appropriate vendor sites.
