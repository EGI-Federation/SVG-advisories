This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's purpose
"To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be correct.
The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on how the software is used.
This was handled according to the EGI SVG issue handling procedure [R 1] which has since been
replaced by [R 2] approved by the Operations Management Board in November 2017.
