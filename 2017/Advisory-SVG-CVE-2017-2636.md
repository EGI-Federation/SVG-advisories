Package : Linux kernel
CVE ID  : CVE-2017-2636

A local privilege escalation race condition in n_hdlc in linux kernel driver
has been found.  [R 1], [R 2]

This vulnerability is present in all recent versions of the linux kernel prior
to the patched versions.

All recent versions of the linux kernel prior to the patched versions are
affected.

More information
================

More information can be found at [R 1], [R 2], [R 3]

If this vulnerability is found to be exploitable in the EGI infrastructure it
will be elevated to 'CRITICAL' and require sites to update urgently.
Hence we recommend that sites update as soon as possible.

Note that this is a new vulnerability, this is NOT an update of CVE-2017-6074
although the effect and risk are similar, and hence SVG is making similar
recommendations.
