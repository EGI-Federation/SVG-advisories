EGI SVG   ADVISORY [EGI-SVG-2012-3438]

Title:        EMI VOMS CRL handling vulnerability 'Low' RISK

Date:         2012-03-03
Updated:      2012-04-02


URL:         https://advisories.egi.eu/2012/Advisory-SVG-2012-3438

Introduction
============

A vulnerability has been found in EMI VOMS which may allow a user whose
certificate has been revoked to generate a VOMS proxy.  This was reported to
the EGI SVG.

Another result of the software bug that results in this vulnerability is that
some certificates are rejected even though they are valid.

This problem has been fixed and a new version is available.


Details
=======

There is an error in the EMI VOMS service specific to the c/c++ VOMS daemons
which handles CRLs incorrectly.

This error allows most users who possess a revoked certificate to get a VOMS
attribute certificate bound to the revoked certificate. This is considered to
be a 'Low' risk security error since most services carry out further checking
of the certificates and will reject the VOMS proxy associated with the revoked
certificate.

However, another result of this software bug is that some valid certificates
may be rejected.

Risk Category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'Low' risk by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment Team.
However, greater urgency for fixing this issue results from the rejection of
valid certificates.


Affected Software
=================

This problem is found in VOMS 2.0.2 released in EMI.

The problem is fixed in  VOMS 2.0.7 released as part of EMI Update 14 and is
available in UMD 1.6.0.

gLite 3.1 and gLite 3.2 are not affected, as they contain different CRL
handling software.


Mitigation
==========

No mitigation is recommended.


Component Installation information
==================================

vulnerability but also to avoid rejection of valid certificates.
