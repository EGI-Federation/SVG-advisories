Title:       EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE]  'MODERATE' risk - multiple vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel
             (incl. CVE-2018-8897, CVE-2018-1087, CVE-2017-16939) [EGI-SVG-CVE-2018-8897]

Date:        2018-05-16
Updated:

Affected software and risk
==========================

Multiple vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel have been patched.

The patched version, kernel-3.10.0-862(.2.3) is released together with the release of RHEL 7.5

Package : Linux Kernel
CVE ID  : CVE-2018-8897, CVE-2018-1087, CVE-2017-16939

- A vulnerability in the Linux kernel exception handling can allow an unprivileged user to crash the system and
cause a Denial of Service (DoS) (CVE-2018-8897).

- A  vulnerability concerning the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor exception handling can allow an unprivileged
KVM guest user to crash the guest or, potentially, escalate their privileges in the guest (CVE-2018-1087).

- The 'use-after-free' vulnerability flaw in XFRM mentioned in a previous alert [EGI-SVG-CVE-2017-16939] can,
in some circumstances, lead to privilege escalation.

None at present are considered by the SVG to be more than 'Moderate'.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update their linux kernel at their first convenient opportunity, in particular:--

- WN & UI should be updated for CVE-2018-8897

- WN & UI with Singularity in non-suid mode should be updated for CVE-2017-16939

- Hypervisors should be updated for CVE-2018-1087

Note that a re-boot is required.

More information
================

These vulnerabilities mentioned above are the ones which are most relevant to EGI and have been
assessed as unlikely to pose more than 'Moderate' Risk for the EGI infrastructure.

For a full list vulnerabilities which are fixed in this release see [R 1]

There is the possibility that the risk could be elevated to 'High', particularly for CVE-2018-1087
if a privilege escalation exploit were to become available.

Since the exception handling vulnerability has been highly publicised, see e.g. [R 2], sites should update
as soon as convenient.

Also see [R 3], [R 4], [R 5], [R 6]


Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RedHat should see [R 1]

Sites running Scientific Linux should see [R 7]

Sites running CentOS should see [R 8]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 9]

Sites running Debian should see [R 10]

Context
=======

This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's purpose
"To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling procedure [R 11]
in the context of how the software is used in the EGI infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group,
we do not guarantee it to be correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments
depending on how the software is used.
