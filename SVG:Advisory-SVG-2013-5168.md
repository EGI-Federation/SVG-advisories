Introduction
============

A vulnerability was found in GSI-OpenSSH and fixed by the globus team.

This is now available in the version of GSI-OpenSSH in EGI UMD 2, in release 2.7.0

This software not included in UMD 3 so this advisory is not relevant to sides running
software from UMD-3

Details
=======

Details are as below in the original Globus advisory appended.

Globus Original Advisory
========================
GSI-OpenSSH Security Advisory: pamuserchange-2013-01.adv

URL: http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/ssh/pamuserchange-2013-01.adv

Original issue date: March 12 2013
Last revised: None

Software affected:
  GSI-OpenSSH (versions 4.7-5.5)
  GSI patch for OpenSSH (versions 20090831-20120903)

1. Overview

GSI-OpenSSH is a modified version of OpenSSH that adds support for RFC
3820 proxy certificate authentication and delegation. GSI-OpenSSH is provided
by NCSA and is not associated with the OpenSSH project.
GSI-OpenSSH is provided as both a standalone package and as a patch to OpenSSH.

The PermitPAMUserChange feature added to GSI-OpenSSH in August 2009 [1] based on
an earlier OpenSSH patch [2] contains a memory management bug that may allow an
authenticated user to log in to an unauthorized account. The PermitPAMUserChange
feature is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by the system administrator.
It is used primarily with MEG (MyProxy Enabled GSISSHD) [3].

The PermitPAMUserChange feature allows users to log in to a system using a username that
need not correspond to a local system account, provided that PAM accepts the username,
authenticates the user, and then maps the user to an existing local system account via
PAM_USER.
The memory management bug can cause the authenticated user to be mapped to an account
different than PAM_USER.

2. Affected Configurations

Default configurations of GSI-OpenSSH are not affected.

The bug can be triggered only if sshd_config contains "PermitPAMUserChange yes" and
/etc/pam.d/sshd (or equivalent) is configured with a PAM module that modifies PAM_USER.

3. Mitigation

Removing "PermitPAMUserChange yes" from sshd_config (if it was previously added by the
system administrator) will disable the affected functionality.

4. Fix

GSI-OpenSSH 5.6 contains a fix for this bug.

Alternatively system administrators may apply the following patch to the
GSI-OpenSSH source code:
