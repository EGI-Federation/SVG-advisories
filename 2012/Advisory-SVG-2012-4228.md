Introduction
============

A vulnerability has been found in some Unicore components which may allow a
user to impersonate another user.

This has been fixed in the version of Unicore currently available in EGI UMD 2.


Details
=======


A vulnerability in some implemetations of SAML has been reported [R 1].

This may allow a user to impersonate another user.

Members of the SVG investigated and some of the Unicore components were found
to be vulnerable.

Two types of exploit were found.

One which potentially allows a user to delete another users workflow, but it is
unlikely any sites are configured in a way which allows this.

One allows impersonation, but can only be exploited in very rare circumstances.

No other middleware used in EGI is known to be vulnerable.


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'Low' risk by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment Team


Affected software
=================

The following Unicore components are affected:

   Unicore/X

   U. Registry

   Workflow Service

   Service Orchestrator


Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites
is repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution
(UMD).

Sites using the EGI UMD should see:

http://repository.egi.eu/category/umd_releases/distribution/umd-2/

This was released as part of the UMD update 2.6.0 on 12th June 2013


Sites installing directly from EMI should see:

http://www.eu-emi.eu/emi-2-matterhorn/updates/

This was released as part of the EMI 2 Update 8 on 28th January 2013.



Recommendations
===============

Sites are recommended to update relevant components in due course, if they have
not updated since the software was released.
