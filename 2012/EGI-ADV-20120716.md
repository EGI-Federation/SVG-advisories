Title: Unsupported Operating System / Grid Middleware releases [EGI-ADV-20120709]

Date: July 16, 2012

Last update:

Our monitoring indicates that your site provides services that are
running on Operating System and/or Middleware versions that have reached
the end of their life cycles and therefore security updates will no
longer be provided.

Consequently, if a critical vulnerability affecting this software is
published it will be necessary to immediately stop the affected
servers/services and reinstall with currently supported software
releases.

If you are running an LCG-CE on a platform derived from RHEL4 (CentOS4,
SL\*4), you have already been informed that if you do not migrate away
from this software you will be asked to shutdown services on October 1st
or your site will be suspended. Of course if, for any service or the
operating system, a serious vulnerability is found before that date
suspension may be done even earlier\!

To avoid major service availability disruptions we strongly advise sites
to migrate away from the Operating System / gLite Releases listed in the
Broadcasts sent in February (RedHat) and April (gLite) 2012.
