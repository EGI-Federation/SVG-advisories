Title:       EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' **UPDATE** [TLP:WHITE] 'HIGH' risk - 2 HTCondor Security Vulnerabilities [EGI-SVG-2021-17304]

Date:        2021-07-29
Updated:     2021-08-03, 2021-09-07

Affected software and risk
==========================

2 vulnerabilities concerning HTCondor, one of which is HIGH risk.

Package : HTCondor

2 vulnerabilities in HTCondor [R 1] [R 2] have been found and fixed by the HTCondor team, including one
which may allow a user to run code as another user and/or read the data accessible to that user's running jobs,
this is considered 'HIGH' risk for the EGI infrastructure. The second vulnerability applies only to sites that
have enabled the use of SciTokens.

**UPDATE 2021-09-07**

Changed to [TLP:WHITE] and placed on the wiki.

**UPDATE 2021-08-03**

HTCONDOR-2021-0003 [R 1] was NOT fully resolved in the previous release referred to in the advisory on 2021-07-29,
therefore the HTCondor team have released another version.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running HTCondor are recommended to update as soon as they reasonably can.

Component installation information
==================================

HTCondor may be downloaded from [R 3]

See 'more information' below from the HTCondor team and OSG.

Affected software details
=========================

**UPDATE 2021-08-03 **

HTCONDOR-2021-0003 [R 1] was NOT fully resolved in versions 8.8.14, 9.0.3, 9.1.1

These vulnerabilities are fixed in the following versions of HTCondor

  8.8.15, 9.0.4,  9.1.2


More information  - Provided by the HTCondor team/OSG
======================================================

**UPDATE 2021-08-03**

referring to HTCondor 8.8.14, 9.0.3, and 9.1.1.

Unfortunately, these releases did not fully mitigate the vulnerability described in HTCONDOR-2021-0003.
An attacker with access to the SchedLog file in the HTCondor LOG directory is still able to exploit this vulnerability.

We are now releasing HTCondor 8.8.15, 9.0.4, and 9.1.2 to fully address this issue.


These releases contain important fixes for security issues.
Affected users should update as soon as possible.

More details on the security issues are in the Vulnerability Reports [R 1] [R 2]



From OSG:--

Two security vulnerabilities have been discovered in HTCondor, HTCONDOR-2021-0003 [R 1] and HTCONDOR-2021-0004 [R 2],
both of which allow unprivileged users to perform unauthorized actions.

 The OSG Security team considers these vulnerabilities to be of HIGH severity and recommend updating HTCondor
to the fixed version as soon as possible.

 ## IMPACTED VERSIONS:

 HTCONDOR-2021-0003 affects SchedD and Collector components in all versions of HTCondor.
 HTCONDOR-2021-0004 affects all daemons from version 9.0.0 and above.

 ## WHAT IS THE VULNERABILITY:

 HTCONDOR-2021-003 allows a user with read access to a SchedD or Collector to discover secrets that could allow them
to control other user's jobs and/or read their data.

 HTCONDOR-2021-004 may allow users bearing a SciToken to be granted authorizations beyond what the token should allow.

 ## WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

 Update any HTCondor-CEs, HTCondor access points, and HTCondor central managers to a fixed version of the software
[R 3] (8.8.14, 9.0.3 or 9.1.1) as soon as reasonably possible.

A workaround for HTCONDOR-2021-0004 can be implemented by not allowing SciTokens as an authentication method
until the patch can be applied. This means overriding the list of authentication methods (which includes SciTokens by default)
by setting SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS to all the methods you would actually like to use. To simply remove SciTokens,
set it to "FS,TOKEN,KERBEROS,GSI,SSL". [R 2]
