Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] MODERATE risk 
         - Version of golang used by Singularity 
          [EGI-SVG-CVE-2021-44717]

Affected software and risk
==========================

MODERATE risk vulnerability concerning golang used by Singularity

Package : golang version used in Singularity
CVE ID  : CVE-2021-44717 (in golang)

Note that this advisory is based on the OSG notification 

A security vulnerability in golang has been announced that can potentially 
lead to a vulnerability in singularity.  The OSG security team considers 
the risk of this vulnerability to be MODERATE in relation to Singularity.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running Singularity are recommended to upgrade to a version of 
singularity compiled with the newer golang.  For those using the EPEL rpms, 
upgrade to version 3.8.5-2 which is currently in epel-testing and should 
be promoted to epel by the end of next week.


Affected software details
=========================

Any version of singularity compiled using golang 1.16.11 or older or using 
1.17 through 1.17.4 is impacted. This includes EPEL singularity 
rpms 3.8.5-1 or earlier.


More Information
================

Prior to golang 1.16.12 and 1.17.5, the syscall.ForkExec function had a flaw 
that can result in output for one file descriptor to be redirected to another 
under conditions of running out of file descriptors [R 1].  Singularity uses 
that library call, so it is potentially affected [R 2]. There is no specific 
known exploit at this time, but especially for setuid-root installations it 
is better to ensure that a newly compiled version is installed.
