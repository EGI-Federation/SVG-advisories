Affected software and risk
==========================

MODERATE risk vulnerability concerning dCache

Package : dCache

A vulnerability has been found in dCache where a group ACL might apply to a 
user with the same numeric id. This may in some rare circumstances allow a 
user to gain access to restricted resources. 

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update relevant components as soon as it is 
convenient.

Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for 
EGI sites is repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified
Middleware Distribution (UMD).

https://repository.egi.eu/

The fixed version of dCache is not yet in the EGI UMD repository


Sites installing directly from dCache should see [R 1]. 


Affected software details
=========================

This has been resolved in dCache versions 6.2.31, 7.0.20, 7.1.11 and 7.2.1  

Earlier versions may be vulnerable. 

More information
================

This information has been provided by the dCache team:

There is a vulnerability whereby the group flag on ACLs is lost when set 
through dcache admin commands.

dCache supports two ways of setting ACLs - one setting the nfs4_setfacl 
command and the other setting the dCache admin command. 

Though they are very similar, they have a differences.

The admin interface uses the GROUP keyword to associate the Access Control 
Entry (ACE) with a user group, however in this case dCache associates the 
ACE with a user if additional 'g' (subject is a group) flag is not set. 
As a result, a user may get access to restricted resources.


TLP and URL
===========

** WHITE information - Unlimited distribution 
- see  https://confluence.egi.eu/display/EGIG/Traffic+Light+Protocol  
       for distribution restrictions **
