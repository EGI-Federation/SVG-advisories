Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' **UPDATE** [TLP:WHITE] HIGH risk - Squid
         Vulnerability  [EGI-SVG-2021-17247]

Date:    2021-05-12
Updated: 2021-06-03


Update 2021-06-03
=================

EGI UMD 4 has been updated with frontier-squid-4.15-1.2 that fixes the
vulnerability.


Affected software and risk
==========================

HIGH risk vulnerability concerning Squid

Package : Squid, including Frontier Squid [R 3] before version 4.15

The Squid project has publicly announced [R 1] new vulnerabilities, one of
which is deemed HIGH risk, viz. CVE-2020-25097 [R 2], because it may allow
services to be exposed that are not directly accessible from the client host.
The other ones only concern potential denial of service and hence are deemed
low risk.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update relevant components or apply the mitigation
detailed below as soon as possible.


Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites
is repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution
(UMD).

Sites using frontier-squid from the EGI UMD 4 should see:

    http://repository.egi.eu/sw/production/umd/4/centos7/x86_64/updates/

The fixed version is frontier-squid-4.15-1.2.


Sites installing Squid from anywhere else should see information from their
provider.

Fixed versions (squid-3.5.20-17.el7_9.6) are available for RHEL 7 [R 5], CentOS
7 [R 6], SL 7 [R 7].


Mitigation
==========

For sites that cannot upgrade in a timely manner, temporary workarounds for the
high-risk vulnerability are provided here.

If frontier-squid is used, update customize.sh with the following line and
either reload or restart frontier-squid:

    setoption("uri_whitespace", "deny")



If a plain squid is used instead, set the "uri_whitespace" directive in
squid.conf to either:

    uri_whitespace deny

or

    uri_whitespace encode

and restart the squid service.


Affected software details
=========================

All versions of squid and frontier-squid earlier than 4.15 are affected.


Additional information
======================

Note that exposure of squid services should usually be limited by access
control to addresses within a local area network.


TLP and URL
