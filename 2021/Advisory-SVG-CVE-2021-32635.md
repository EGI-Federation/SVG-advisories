Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] Singularity security updates
         [EGI-SVG-CVE-2021-32635]

Date:    2021-06-22
Updated:


Affected software and risk
==========================

Package : Singularity
CVE ID  : CVE-2021-32635, CVE-2021-29136

A vulnerability has been found in Singularity where it is possible for someone
to publish a malicious container that takes priority over a container that a
user is expecting to run. [R 1] No way has been identified where this may be
exploited in EGI - CVE-2021-32635.

A vulnerability has been found in Singularity where there is the potential for
an attacker to overwrite host files, CVE-2021-29136 this was fixed earlier -
See [R 2]

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites and users with their own Singularity installations are advised to Update
to Singularity v3.7.4 at their earliest convenience if they have not done so
already.

If anyone becomes aware of any situation where these vulnerabilities may have a
significant impact on the EGI infrastructure, then please inform EGI SVG.


Component installation information
==================================

See [R 1]


Affected software details
========================

This vulnerability CVE-2021-32635 is fixed in singularity 3.7.4 - Singularity
3.7.2 and 3.7.3 are vulnerable.

Singularity version 3.7.3 additionally fixes CVE-2021-29136


More information
================

This information is provided by the Singularity team on the 3.7.4 release:--

A security vulnerability in Singularity has been publicly announced [R 3].
Under conditions unlikely to occur for OSG users, it is possible for someone to
publish a malicious container that takes priority over a container that a user
is expecting to run.

The OSG Security team considers the vulnerability to be of MODERATE severity.

IMPACTED VERSIONS:

Singularity 3.7.2 and 3.7.3

WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

By default, singularity commands that use "library://" for downloading
containers read those containers from https://cloud.sylabs.io. That is a
publicly accessible server and anyone may freely create an account there for
storing containers, similar to Docker Hub. Users can also choose to redirect
"library://" references to a private server with the singularity "remote"
command. The vulnerability is that the singularity action commands
(run/shell/exec) always try to download from https://cloud.sylabs.io first, so
someone could publish a container there with the same name as a container on
the private server and the untrusted container from the public server would
instead be used.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

If you have Singularity 3.7.2 or 3.7.3 installed and think some of your users
might be using a private server for library:// containers, notify them to
either not use it until 3.7.4 is available in EPEL or to create an identical
account name for themselves on https://cloud.sylabs.io.




This information is provided by the Singularity team on the 3.7.3 release
fixing CVE-2021-29136:--

The umoci [R 2] binary used by Singularity had an issue where layers with a
symlink name of '.' or '/' could modify host files when unpacking an image.

This vulnerability affects the "singularity build" and "singularity pull"
operations when run as root.  Build/pull from a docker or OCI source is
affected, as well as the implicit build to SIF that occurs through root use of
run/exec/shell against a malicious docker/OCI image URI. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by building an image with a symlink name of '.' or
'/' which could overwrite host files.

Context
=======

This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's
purpose "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software
vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 4]  in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be
correct.  The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending
on how the software is used.
