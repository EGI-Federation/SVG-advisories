Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] CRITICAL risk - Log4j 
        RCE vulnerability CVE-2021-44228. [EGI-SVG-CVE-2021-44228]
        
Date:    2021-12-10
Updated: 2021-12-15, 2022-01-07

Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning Log4j

Package : log4j
CVE ID : CVE-2021-44228

A flaw was found in the Java logging library Apache Log4j 2 which could allow a remote attacker to execute code on the server if the system logs an attacker controlled string value. [R 1], [R 2]

Note that this is true for clients using log4j as well as services.

Some advisories from different providers are collected here [R 3]

This vulnerability is being actively exploited

Exploits are available on the internet  [R 4], [R 5], [R 6] 


Affected Services
=================

We have checked the products in the EGI UMD and so far found none of them to be affected.  

In particular, to the best of our knowledge, the following services/software are NOT affected:  

- Argus 
- dCache 
- INDIGO IAM 
- StoRM WebDAV 
- VOMS-Admin 
- CREAM

The perfSONAR Lookup Service is affected and private instances should thus be patched ASAP [R 15]. Sites typically are using the global instance, though, which has already been patched.

Investigations are continuing as to the impact of this vulnerability on EGI and EOSC.

Actions required
================

At present we are still investigating which services are affected, and which actions sites would be required to take.

Sites are required to take mitigating action if they are aware that they are running the Java logging library Apache Log4j.

Sites should be reminded that if anyone becomes aware of any site or service where this (or any other vulnerability) has been exploited, the EGI CSIRT must be informed according to the procedure at [R 7]

Please inform EGI SVG if you become aware of any service in EGI which is vulnerable to this log4j vulnerability by e-mail to svg-rat at mailman.egi.eu

Affected services must at _least_ not be exposed to the internet.


Component installation information
==================================


Mitigation
==========

Limited and temporary mitigation might be available, see [R 8], [R 9] for details. 

Affected software details
=========================

Any java-based web service that uses log4j for its logging is potentially vulnerable. At this point we do not have a full list of services.

**UPDATE 2022-01-07** 

The fix in version 2.16 was also found to be incomplete.  

Those running Java 8 should update to Log4j 2.17.1.

Those running Java 7 should update to Log4j 2.12.4

Those running Java 6 should update to Log4j 2.3.2.

See [R 2] 

A general list of software which may be vulnerable is available at [R 11], [R 12]

More information
================

See [R 1], [R 13], [R 14]

Updates will be made when more information is available, or any more specific actions are required within EGI.
