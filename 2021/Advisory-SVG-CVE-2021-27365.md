Title:       EGI SVG 'ADVISORY'  [TLP:WHITE] CRITICAL risk Local Privilege Escalation via iSCSI
CVE-2021-27365 [EGI-SVG-CVE-2021-27365]

Date:    2021-03-17
Updated: 2021-04-19, 2021-06-01

Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning Local Privilege Escalation via iSCSI

Package : Linux iSCSI
CVE ID  : CVE-2021-27363, CVE-2021-27364, CVE-2021-27365

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A heap buffer overflow in the iSCSI
subsystem is triggered by setting an iSCSI string attribute to a value larger
than one page and then trying to read it. The highest threat from this
vulnerability is a Local Privilege Escalation to root. [R 1]

More information in [R 2], [R 3]

Actions required/recommended
============================

** UPDATE 2021-04-19 **

Updates are now available for RHEL 7, RHEL 8, [R 1] and CentOS7 [R 5].

Updates also appear to be available for Scientific Linux, as the appropriate
version of the kernel is in the repository [R 6], and notification sent [R 7]
even though the errata [R 8] has not been updated.

** UPDATE 2 2021-04-19 **

All running resources MUST be either patched or have mitigation
in place or software removed by 2021-04-27  00:00 UTC

Sites failing to act and/or failing to respond to requests from the EGI CSIRT
team risk site suspension.

Note: the iSCSI subsystem is only required on hosts that actually have some
need to interact with SCSI HW via a network.


Component installation information
==================================

Sites installing RHEL should see [R 1]

Sites installing CentOS7 should see [R 5]

Sites installing Scientific Linux should see [R 7]

Mitigation
==========

This has been copied directly from the RedHat site [R 1]

The LIBISCSI module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled
by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:

# echo "install libiscsi /bin/true" >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-libiscsi.conf

The system will need to be restarted if the libiscsi modules are loaded. In
most circumstances, the libiscsi kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded
while any network interfaces are active and the protocol is in use.

If the system requires iscsi to work correctly, this mitigation may not be
suitable.


More information
================

At least 1 site in the UK has carried out the mitigation, and no problems have
been experienced.

Sites may wish to try `lsmod | grep iscsi` to find out if iSCSI has been loaded
prior to carrying out the mitigation.

An update will be provided when this vulnerability has been fixed.

Context
=======

This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's
purpose "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software
vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 4] in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be
correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on
how the software is used.
