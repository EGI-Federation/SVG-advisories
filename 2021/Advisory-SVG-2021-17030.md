Affected software and risk
==========================

2 CRITICAL risk vulnerabilities concerning HTCondor

Package : HTCondor

2 vulnerabilities have been found concerning HTCondor, affecting a limited
number of versions.
One may allow any authenticated user to impersonate any other user on the
Condor system, and potentially reconfigure the HTCondor daemons.  The other may
allow any authenticated user to  overwrite any file.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Any site running HTCondor versions 8.9.2 through 8.9.10 should consider taking
action.

There are 3 options, install the 8.8.X stable series, update prior to the
public release using the instructions below, or carry out the mitigation below
until the fix is released publicly.

Releases 8.8.X (STABLE SERIES) are NOT vulnerable.

Mitigation
==========

From the HTCondor team:--

For the impersonation vulnerability affecting HTCondor 8.9.2 through 8.9.10
(inclusive):--

If you do not need to use IDTOKENS, you can disable that authentication method
by specifying a list of authentication mechanisms that does not include it.

On Linux, you would want to set, e.g., (removing any other methods you did not
want to use):
SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = FS,PASSWORD,SSL,GSI,KERBEROS,MUNGE

On Windows, you would want to set, e.g., (removing any other methods you did
not want to use):
SEC_DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_METHODS = NTSSPI,PASSWORD,SSL,KERBEROS

You should also check your configuration for other places you may have
explicitly set the list of methods:
condor_config_val -dump AUTHENTICATION_METHODS
After making any changes, you will need to run
condor_reconfig

For the File overwrite Vulnerability:--

Do not enable the condor_credd if you are not depending on it.


Component installation information
==================================

From the HTCondor team:--

If you decide to install v8.9.11 ahead of the public release on January 27, you
will need to add an additional repository to your system as detailed below.

After January 27, the v8.9.11 release will be in the usual public HTCondor
repositories, so you can upgrade in your usual manner.

Use the repo that matches your system:

    (cd /etc/yum.repos.d; wget "repo URL")

Enterprise Linux 7:

https://v8911:GsktumXnevC8SwGE@research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/repo/8.9/el7/private/htcondor-v8911.repo

Enterprise Linux 8:

https://v8911:GsktumXnevC8SwGE@research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/repo/8.9/el8/private/htcondor-v8911.repo

Amazon Linux 2:

https://v8911:GsktumXnevC8SwGE@research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/repo/8.9/amzn2/private/htcondor-v8911.repo

If you are installing on a Debian/Ubuntu use the security repository in
addition to the regular repository.

Use the repo that matches your system:

    (cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d; wget "repo URL")
