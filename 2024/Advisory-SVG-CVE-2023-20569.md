Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' HIGH risk AMD CPU Processor Vulnerability
         [EGI-SVG-CVE-2023-20569]

Date:    2023-08-23
Updated: 2023-02-19

Affected software and risk
==========================

HIGH risk vulnerability concerning AMD Processors

Package    : AMD Processors
CVE ID     : CVE-2023-20569
CVSS Score : 5.6 [R 1]

A speculative side channel attack vulnerability known as 'Inception' or 'RAS Poisoning'
has been found affecting AMD processors. This may lead to information disclosure [R 2].

**UPDATE 2024-02-19**

RHEL 7 has since been said by RedHat to be affected and updates produced.  

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to check whether their processors are affected, and then
update the firmware as appropriate.

If anyone becomes aware of any situation where this vulnerability has a
 significant impact on the EGI infrastructure then please inform EGI SVG.

Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RHEL should see [R 1] 

Sites running CentOS Stream should also see [R 1]

Sites running Debian should see [R 4]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 5]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 6] 

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 7]

More information
================

Details from AMD are available at [R 2].
More information including a description of the type of vulnerability is at [R 8]. 
Further info at [R 9]

**UPDATE 2024-02-19**

Since RHEL 7 is now said to be affected, derivatives such as Scientific Linux are
likely to be affected. 
    
Although RedHat and others consider this to be 'Medium' risk, with a CVSS score of 5.6,
we the EGI SVG consider it to be 'High' risk because for Grid and Cloud computing
processors are accessible by a number of people.

There are reports of potentially significant, workflow-dependent performance degradations.
