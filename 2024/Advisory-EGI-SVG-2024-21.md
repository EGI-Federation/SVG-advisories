Updated:     2024-09-26, 2024-10-24

## IDs AND CVSS SCORE 

EGI SVG ID : EGI-SVG-2024-21
    
CVE ID     : CVE-2024-45409

CVSS Score : 10 [R 1]
    

## ACTIONS REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED

Any GitLab services running in the wider EGI infrastructure should urgently 
update using references below.

If anyone becomes aware of any additional situation where this vulnerability 
may have an impact on the EGI infrastructure, then please inform EGI SVG.


## MORE INFORMATION

The Ruby SAML library is used for implementing the client side of a SAML authorization. 
Ruby-SAML in <= 12.2 and 1.13.0 <= 1.16.0 does not properly verify the signature of 
the SAML Response. An unauthenticated attacker with access to any signed SAML response 
(by the IdP) can thus forge a SAML Response/Assertion with arbitrary contents. 
This would allow the attacker to log in as arbitrary user within the vulnerable system. 
This vulnerability is fixed in ruby-saml 1.17.0 and 1.12.3 [R 1], 
omniauth_saml versions 2.2.1, 2.1.2 and 1.10.5 [R3] and 
GitLab versions 17.3.3, 17.2.7, 17.1.8, 17.0.8, 16.11.10 [R2].
