## Advisory-EGI-SVG-2024-10

# HIGH risk glibc vulnerability 

Date:        2024-05-03
Updated:     2024-06-04

A HIGH risk vulnerability has been found concerning glibc where an 
out-of-bounds write flaw in the ISO-2022-CN-EXT plugin for glibc's 
iconv library may allow remote code execution. [R 1] 

## IDs AND CVSS SCORE

EGI SVG ID : EGI-SVG-2024-10
    
CVE ID     : CVE-2024-2961

CVSS Score : 8.8 [R 1]

## AFFECTED SOFTWARE AND VERSIONS

The affected version is several years old, version 2.28 [R 2]
But this version is included with the common Linux versions

**UPDATE 2024-06-03**

This has been fixed for many Linux versions including RHEL [R 1]

## ACTIONS REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED

Sites are recommended to update if a fixed version is available
for the Linux version they deploy.

Until then sites are recommended to carry out the mitigation below.


## MITIGATION

The mitigation would be to disable this encoding:


Check if your OS is running a vulnerable version:

```
# rpm -qa| grep glib
glibc-2.28-246.el8.x86_64
or
# ldd --version
ldd (GNU libc) 2.28
```

Check if  the vulnerable encoding is enabled:
```
#  echo "iconv -l | grep -E ‘CN-?EXT’" | iconv -t ASCII//TRANSLIT//IGNORE
ISO-2022-CN-EXT//
ISO2022CNEXT//
```
To disable it:

```
# cd /usr/lib64/gconv/gconv-modules.d
Comment it out from gconv-modules-extra.conf:
  #       from                    to                      module          cost
  #alias  ISO2022CNEXT//          ISO-2022-CN-EXT//
  #module ISO-2022-CN-EXT//       INTERNAL                ISO-2022-CN-EXT 1
  #module INTERNAL                ISO-2022-CN-EXT//       ISO-2022-CN-EXT 1
```
or 
```
# cat gconv-modules-extra.conf | grep -v -E 'CN-?EXT' > gconv-modules-extra-patched.conf
# rm gconv-modules-extra.conf
```
Delete the cache and regenerate it as follows:
```
# rm gconv-modules.cache
# iconvconfig
```
The location of the configuration file depends on the OS, you can find it by:
```
# find /usr -name gconv
```
