       information  [SVG EGI-SVG-2014-7009]

Date:  2014-08-05

Introduction
============

A vulnerability has been found in dCache [R 1] by the dCache team which allows
remote access to the dCache configuration information.

This has been resolved both in versions of dcache available on the dcache site
and in the EGI UMD repository.


Details
=======

This vulnerability is confirmed to exist in the software and be exploitable in
principle by anyone with no credentials.  It was found that sites in EGI were
all configured in ways which made it not possible to actually exploit this
vulnerability.
The vulnerability should not be in the software, hence it has been fixed in the
UMD.


Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'Moderate'  risk by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment
Team.


Affected software
=================

dCache

Affected versions of dCache are:
================================

v2.6.0 through to v2.6.26 (inclusive),
v2.7.0 through to v2.7.8 (inclusive),
v2.8.0 through to v2.8.5 (inclusive),
v2.9.0 through to v2.9.1 (inclusive).

Unaffected (fixed) versions of dCache are
---------------------------------

v2.2.0 and later v2.2 releases,
v2.6.27 and later v2.6 releases,
v2.7.9 and later v2.7 releases,
v2.8.6 and later v2.8 releases,
v2.9.2 and later v2.9 releases.
all subsequent feature releases.

Note that v2.6.28 in UMD-3.8.0 is the latest version in the EGI UMD and this
has the vulnerability resolved.


Mitigation
==========

No sites were found to be configured in a vulnerable manner, so we do not
include mitigation information.


Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites
is repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution
(UMD).


Sites using the EGI UMD 3 should see:

http://repository.egi.eu/category/umd_releases/distribution/umd-3/

Not vulnerable version of dcache in UMD-3.8.0

http://repository.egi.eu/2014/07/24/release-umd-3-8-0/


Sites installing from EMI should see using

http://www.eu-emi.eu/releases/emi-3-monte-bianco/updates/

A fixed version is in EMI 3 update 17.


Sites may also install directly from the dCache site. [R 1]



Recommendations
