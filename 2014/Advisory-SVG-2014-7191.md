Introduction
============

Two vulnerabilities were found in Cacti by a member of the EGI software
vulnerability group.

The only place in the EGI infrastructure where cacti is in use that we are
aware of is sites running Perfsonar.

This advisory is to alert sites to this, and suggest sites check that suitable
mitigation is in place, as recommended by the perfsonar team.

Fixes are available for this particular cacti issue for debian, but not redhat.

The two vulnerabilities have CVEs assigned CVE-2014-5261 [R 1], CVE-2014-5262
[R 2]


Details
=======

For the description of the cacti vulnerabilities see [R 1] and [R 2]


Risk category
=============

These vulnerabilities have both been assessed as 'High' risk by the EGI SVG
Risk Assessment Team, if sites are configured badly.


Affected software
=================

These are fixed in debian, see [R 3], [R 4]

For RedHat they have not yet been fixed.
The upstream release fixing these issues is cacti-0.8.8c



Mitigation
==========

Sites can mitigate cacti problems by doing both of the following:

- put behind firewall/only trusted people should be able to access the
  webfrontend
- remove the line
 $guest_account = true;
 from the top of graph_settings.php


Sites running perfsonar should ensure that they are configured correctly
according to the instructions given by the perfsonar team [R 5].

Information on security considerations is also provided by the perfsonar team
[R 6]



Component installation information
==================================

For Debian, see [R 3] [R 4]

For RedHat they have not yet been fixed.
The upstream release fixing these issues is cacti-0.8.8c



Recommendations
===============

Sites running cacti/perfsonar should ensure that they are configured in a
suitable way as described by the Perfsonar team in the link above.

This is regardless of whether the cacti version is updated.

Sites running debian version, additionally should update.


Other information
==================

This was discussed at the SVG meeting on 20th November, and agreed that an
advisory should be sent advising sites to ensure they are configured correctly.
Agreed 'High' risk for poorly configured sites.
