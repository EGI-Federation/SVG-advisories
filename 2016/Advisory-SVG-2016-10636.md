Title:   EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] Moderate risk - OpenStack sites VM
         Management permissions - check [EGI-SVG-2016-10636]

Date:    2016-04-13
Updated: 2016-04-28 - Set to [TLP:WHITE] and placed on the wiki.


Affected Software and Risk
==========================

Some OpenStack sites have been found to have incorrect Management permissions.


Actions Required/Recommended
============================

Sites in the EGI Federated cloud should check they are correctly configured,
see [R 1].

Risk category
=============

This issue has been assessed as 'Moderate' by the EGI SVG Risk Assessment Team.

More information
================

Some cloud sites running OpenStack have been found to use the default
configuration where every group member can manage the VMs of the group. The EGI
installation manual for OpenStack includes a policy to avoid this behaviour [R
1], although it seems not to be applied everywhere.

This default configuration includes deleting other people's VMs (which is what
some people have suffered from) or changing their public IPs.

This issue is exploitable by all other members of the VO of which the VM
Operator is a member.

There was a concern that using the OpenStack APIs with this kind of permission
might allow a user to "rescue" someone else's VM [R 2] and thereby access the
original VM disks, and hence any credentials or other private data stored
there.  However, such abuse would be prevented by the OpenStack security
framework.

An incorrect configuration thus would allow denial of service and loss of
(transient) data.

We ask sites to check their configuration and modify if necessary.
