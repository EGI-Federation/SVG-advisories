Title:   EGI SVG Advisory **UPDATE**[TLP:WHITE] 'HIGH' risk CVE-2016-7117 Linux
         kernel vulnerability [EGI-SVG-CVE-2016-7117]

Date:    2016-11-10
Updated: 2016-12-14, 2017-01-13, 2017-01-18

Affected software and risk
==========================

**UPDATE 2017-01-18** Patches are now available for RedHat 7 and Scientific
Linux 7

**UPDATE 2017-01-13** Patches now available for RedHat 6 and Scientific Linux
6.

**UPDATE 2016-12-14** Downgraded from 'CRITICAL' risk to 'HIGH' risk.

'HIGH' risk vulnerability concerning the Linux kernel Use-after-free in the
recvmmsg exit path.

Package : Linux Kernel
CVE ID  : CVE-2016-7117

A 'use after free' vulnerability was found in the kernels socket recvmmsg
subsystem.  This may allow a local root exploit and potentially also remote
arbitrary code execution.

Updates are available for most Linux distributions except RedHat and its
derivatives.

**UPDATE 2016-12-14** This has been downgraded to 'HIGH' risk thanks to lack of
news on exploit attempts.

Actions required/recommended
============================

**UPDATE 2017-01-18**

Sites should apply vendor kernel updates as soon as possible if they have not
done so already.

Patches are now available for all Operating systems relevant to EGI.

It is not necessary for sites to reply to this Advisory.


Affected software details
=========================

All Linux distributions, see relevant OS providers.

More information
================

For more information see [R 1], [R 2], [R 3]

**Original Heads up on 2016-11-10** At present no working root exploit has been
made public.  This is a mitigating circumstance. Some members of SVG consider
it likely that one may be made public at any time, hence the assessment of
'Critical'.  For this reason we recommend sites update as soon as possible.

**UPDATE 2016-12-14** No exploit has become available as far as EGI SVG is
aware, so this has been downgraded to 'HIGH' risk. Sites should still update as
soon as possible if they are running a vulnerable version of linux and a
non-vulnerable version has been released.


Mitigation
==========

There is no recommended mitigation to prevent this vulnerability being
exploited.

Component installation information
==================================

Sites running Debian should see [R 5]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 6]

Sites running RedHat should see [R 2], [R 4]

Sites running Scientific Linux (SL) should see [R 7]
