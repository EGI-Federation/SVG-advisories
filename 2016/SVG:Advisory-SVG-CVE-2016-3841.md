Title:   EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] 'High' risk - Linux kernel's IPv6
         implementation - mishandled socket options [EGI-SVG-CVE-2016-3841]

Date:    2016-12-20
Updated:

Affected software and risk
==========================

'HIGH' risk vulnerability concerning Linux kernel's IPv6 implementation -
mishandled socket options.
The IPv6 stack in the Linux kernel before 4.3.3 mishandles options data, which
allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service
(use-after-free and system crash) via a crafted sendmsg system call.  [R 1]

Note: only IPv6-enabled services with kernels from RedHat 7 or a derivative are
affected.
The vulnerable grid service types are the Worker Node and any shared User
Interface.

Package : Linux kernel
CVE ID  : CVE-2016-3841


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running vulnerable services on RedHat 7 or a derivative should update as
soon as possible.

Sites running other versions of the Linux kernel should not be vulnerable, as
the fixes were already in Linux versions mandated to address previous
vulnerabilities.

It is not necessary for sites to respond to this e-mail.


Affected software details
=========================

Sites should see [R 1]

More information
================

Sites should see [R 1] and [R 2]

Mitigation
==========

N/A.


Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RedHat Linux 7 should see [R 1]

Sites running Scientic Linux 7 should see [R 4]
