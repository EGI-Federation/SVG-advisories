Title:   EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] OpenStack Nova Metadata leak - sites
         should check [EGI-SVG-2016-12231]

Affected software and risk
==========================

Vulnerability concerning OpenStack Nova Metadata information leak -
Vulnerability in actual software - but if configured as instructed should not
be exploitable

Package : OpenStack Nova
CVE ID  : (None at present)
Bug ID  : OpenStack 1563954

OpenStack Nova may allow metadata to be leaked, this is a problem if such
metadata contains sensitive information.
This is described in OpenStack Security Notice 0074 [R 1]


Actions required/recommended
============================

Nova metadata service should not be used for sensitive information as described
in [R 1]

Sites and Users who provide metadata which is used by OpenStack Nova should
check that they are not including any sensitive data.

Affected software details
=========================

See [R 1] [R 2]

More information
================

See [R 1] [R 2]

An attacker with access to a compute instance, i.e. a VM, in the cloud could
send a request to the metadata service.  Hence an authorized VM user, i.e. any
user able to perform an http request from a VM, might thus obtain sensitive
information if Nova happens to contain any.  This is independent of who started
a VM.

That scenario then may affect some of the Fed Cloud sites, as well as grid
sites that happen to provide resources through OpenStack.


Component installation information
==================================

N/A at present.
