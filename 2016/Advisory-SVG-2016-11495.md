Title:   EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] 'Moderate' risk vulnerability - VOMS
         server certificate chain/user validation [EGI-SVG-2016-11495]

Date:    2016-11-24
Updated:

Affected software and risk
==========================

MODERATE risk vulnerability concerning VOMS certificate chain/user validation

Package : VOMS
CVE ID  : N/A

The VOMS server may accept proxies that do not comply with RFC 3281, or other
malformed proxies.

It may be possible for VOMS attributes to be obtained with such proxies, but it
is very unlikely that the resulting proxy might be successfully used for
accessing other grid services.
The various security stacks commonly used in grid services were found to

reject such proxies altogether.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update relevant components as soon as it is
convenient.

It is not necessary for sites to respond to this e-mail.

Affected software details
=========================

These problems are fixed in VOMS version 2.0.14 or later.


Mitigation
==========

N/A


Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites
is repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution
