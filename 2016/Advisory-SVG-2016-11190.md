Title:   EGI SVG Advisory [TLP:WHITE] 'HIGH' risk - Authorization by user_id to
         manage VMs does not work in V2.1 Nova API for OpenStack
         [EGI-SVG-2016-11190]

Affected software and risk
==========================

'High' risk vulnerability concerning OpenStack VM management Authorization by
individual user.

Package : OpenStack
CVE ID  : N/A - functionality removed
Bug ID  : OpenStack - https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1539351

Authorization to manage Virtual Machines by individual user_id does no longer
work in V2.1 Nova API for OpenStack. This implies for EGI that users within a
VO can for example delete VMs which do not belong to them, causing a DoS.

Actions required/recommended
============================

For the time being, sites should not upgrade to V2.1 of the Nova API for
OpenStack.

If sites have already upgraded to V2.1 of the Nova API for OpenStack, they
should downgrade to 2.0.

Affected software details
=========================

OpenStack Version 2.1

More information
================

See the bug report [R 1]

The risk may be elevated to 'Critical' if it is found that users are able to
take over other users VMs.

A more permanent solution is being worked on.

There is also a patch provided by CNRS to re-enable the user based
authorization, it may be an alternative to downgrading but we have had no
reports of testing yet. See [R 2]

Mitigation
==========

N/A

Component installation information
==================================

See the OpenStack site.
