Introduction
============

SVG has been alerted to a Persistent XSS in OpenStack in Horizon admin dashboard, in the image metadata pannel.

This may allow privilege escallation.




Details
=======

See [R 1] [R 2] and [R 3]



One member of our team looked at the patch and the vulnerability and the attack scenario would be:
- An authenticated user adds malicious metadata to an image (via the APIs)
- An admin go on the admin panel, then select this very image and look/edit its metadata, the stored XSS will
only be exposed in a page specific to the image, not a summary.

On one site which was investigated, the Horizon admin dashboard was disabled.


Risk category
=============

It is not clear that it is all that easy to exploit this issue in the EGI infrastructure.
However, to be cautious it should be considered  'High' risk if sites are running OpenStack
and the Horizon admin dashboard is enabled.



Affected software
=================


Horizon metadata dashboard.


Mitigation
==========

Sites running OpenStack with the horizon metadata dashboard may disable the horizon metadata dashboard.


Component installation information
==================================

See OpenStack instructions.


Recommendations
===============

Sites running OpenStack with the horizon metadata dashboard enabled should consider either updating
or disabling the horizon metadata dashboard.
