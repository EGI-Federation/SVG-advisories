Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] (up to critical) vulnerabilities
         concerning Squid [EGI-SVG-2020-16203]

Date:    2020-02-11
Updated: 2020-04-29

Affected software and risk
==========================

Various vulnerabilities concerning Squid

Package : Squid, including Frontier Squid.

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Squid, including one which may allow
remote code execution.
For more information see the OSG announcement below.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running Squid or Frontier Squid should update as soon as possible.

Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites
is repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution
(UMD).

Sites installing Frontier Squid from the EGI UMD 4 repository should see:

http://repository.egi.eu/category/umd_releases/distribution/umd-4/

A fixed version of Frontier Squid,  frontier-squid-4.10.1-1 is available in UMD
4.9.2  both for CentOS 7 and SL6.

http://repository.egi.eu/2020/02/10/release-umd-4-9-2/

Sites installing Squid from anywhere else should see information from their
provider.

Note: Red Hat have not yet released updated squid packages that deal with these
vulnerabilities.


Affected software details
=========================

All versions of Squid prior to 4.10-1.1

OSG information
===============

Dear OSG Security Contacts,

Security vulnerabilities have been publicly announced for squid.  OSG has
released a version of frontier-squid with fixes for the vulnerabilities.
All installations of squid should be upgraded.  OSG security considers the
vulnerability affecting reverse proxy installations (such as CVMFS Stratum 1
servers) to be CRITICAL and the vulnerability affecting ordinary proxy
installations to be MODERATE.

IMPACTED VERSIONS:

All versions of frontier-squid prior to 4.10-1.1

WHAT ARE THE VULNERABILITIES:

The first vulnerability [1] affects reverse proxy configurations, where squid
forwards all traffic to a backend server using the http_port 'accel' or 'vhost'
options.
CVMFS Stratum 1 servers are affected.  Due to incorrect input validation, squid
can interpret crafted HTTP requests in unexpected ways to access server
resources prohibited by earlier security filters. Also, due to incorrect buffer
management a remote client can cause a buffer overflow in a Squid acting as
reverse-proxy.
This can result in remote code execution.

The second vulnerability [2] affects squid installations that allow proxying
ftp, which is the default. Due to incorrect data management, squid is
vulnerable to information disclosure when translating FTP server listings into
HTTP responses.  The information may be anything from the heap area including
information from other processes on the machine.  An exploit requires control
of the destination server, so those installations that restrict the destination
servers to a known list of trusted servers should not be affected, but OSG
security still advises upgrading.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO:

Upgrade reverse proxy installations to frontier-squid-4.10-1.1 as soon as
possible, and schedule an upgrade for other installations.

Context
=======

This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's
purpose "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software
vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 3]  in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure.
It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be correct. The risk
may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on how the software
is used.
