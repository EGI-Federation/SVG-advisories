Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] LOW risk vulnerability in dCache
         macaroon bearer token validation [EGI-SVG-2020-16806]

Date:    2020-08-17

Affected software and risk
==========================

LOW risk vulnerability concerning dCache macaroon bearer token validation

Package : dCache

The macaroons are bearer tokens, that can contain a number of restrictions,
like READ-ONLY, VALID-UNTIL, LIMITED-TO-IP.
The result of IP based verification is not respected when it is combined with
other restrictions.

For more information see [R 1].


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update relevant components as soon as it is
convenient.

Sites may update either from the UMD or from the dCache site [R 1]


Component installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites
is repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution
(UMD).

Sites using the EGI UMD 4 should see:

http://repository.egi.eu/category/umd_releases/distribution/umd-4/

A fixed version dCache - 5.2.26 is available in the UMD for both SL6 and
CentOS7 in UMD-4.11.2

http://repository.egi.eu/2020/08/14/release-umd-4-11-2/

Sites installing directly from dCache should see [R 1].


More Information
================

The macaroon based tokens are used by quite a small number of sites and IP
restrictions are used even less.
Few sites are likely to be affected by this vulnerability.

Affected software details
=========================

This is fixed in dcache versions  5.2.26, 6.0.20, 6.1.9 and 6.2.1.

Previous supported versions  5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x and 6.2.x are all affected.

Versions 5.1.x are affected, but these have not been patched as the dCache team
is not aware of any production instances using them.

Versions before 5.1.0 are not affected.

TLP and URL
===========

** WHITE information - Unlimited distribution
- see https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_CSIRT:TLP for distribution restrictions **
