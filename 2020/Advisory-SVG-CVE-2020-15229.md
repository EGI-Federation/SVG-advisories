Affected software and risk
==========================

Package : Singularity
CVE ID  : CVE-2020-15229

A path traversal and file overwrite vulnerability with "unsquashfs" has been
announced, see [R 1].
This may allow files to be overwritten in various scenarios, but it is not
clear how likely it is for the vulnerability to be exploitable in our
environment.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites and users with their own Singularity installations are advised to update
Singularity as soon as it is convenient.

If anyone becomes aware of any situation where this vulnerability may have a
significant impact on the EGI infrastructure, then please inform EGI SVG.

Component installation information
==================================

See [R 1]

Mitigation
==========

No mitigating action has been identified, sites and users are advised to update
in due course.


Affected software details
=========================

Singularity versions 3.1.1 - 3.6.3 are affected

This issue is fixed in version 3.6.4

More information
================

Sites are reminded that they are recommended to enable unprivileged user
namespaces on their worker nodes [R 2]

If it is found that this vulnerability looks exploitable in the EGI
environment, then the EGI SVG will re-examine the issue and assess the risk. It
is possible then that sites may be asked to update urgently.

Users who build their own containers should be careful what they include
especially what they include from the web and avoid doing things as 'root' as
much as possible.
