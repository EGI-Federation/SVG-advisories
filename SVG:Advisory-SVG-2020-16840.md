    Title:       EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] MODERATE risk - Cache Poisoning Squid Vulnerabilities  [EGI-SVG-2020-16840]

    Date:        2020-09-16
    Updated:

    Affected software and risk
    ==========================

    MODERATE risk vulnerabilities concerning Squid

    Package : Squid, including Frontier Squid before version 4.13

    The Squid project has publicly announced new vulnerabilities that can result in Cache poisoning.


    Actions required/recommended
    ============================

    Sites are recommended to update relevant components as soon as it is convenient


    Component installation information
    ==================================

    The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites is
    repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD).

    Sites using the EGI UMD 4 should see:

    http://repository.egi.eu/category/umd_releases/distribution/umd-4/

    Where Frontier Squid 4.13-1.1 is available in the EGI UMD for SL6 and Centos7 as part of UMD-4.11.3

    https://repository.egi.eu/2020/09/15/release-umd-4-11-3/

    Sites installing Squid from anywhere else should see information from their provider.

    NOTE: The squid will be out of service for about a minute during the upgrade.


    Mitigation
    ==========

    For sites that cannot upgrade in a timely manner, a temporary workaround for the
    vulnerabilities is to add the option
            setoption("relaxed_header_parser", "off") to /etc/squid/customize.sh and reload the squid with
            service frontier-squid reload
    This has been tested with CVMFS and Frontier but may impact other applications using the squid.


    Affected software details
    =========================

    All versions of squid and frontier-squid earlier than 4.13 are affected.


    Background information
    ======================

    Two announced vulnerabilities, one for request splitting [R 1] and one for request
    smuggling [R 2] can both lead to cache poisoning.  Cache poisoning will lead to
    only denial of service for CVMFS, but could potentially be more serious for the
    Frontier application used by CMS and ATLAS, or for other applications that might
    be using the squid.  Note that exposure to squids is usually limited by access
    control to addresses within a local area network.


    TLP and URL
    ===========

    ** WHITE information - Unlimited distribution
       - see https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/EGI_CSIRT:TLP for distribution restrictions***

    URL:   https://wiki.egi.eu/wiki/SVG:Advisory-SVG-2020-16840

    Minor updates may be made without re-distribution to the sites


    Comments
    ========

    Comments or questions should be sent to svg-rat  at  mailman.egi.eu

    If you find or become aware of another vulnerability which is relevant to EGI you may report it by e-mail to

    report-vulnerability at egi.eu

    the EGI Software Vulnerability Group will take a look according to the procedure defined in [R 4]

    Note that this is undergoing revision to fully handle vulnerabilities in the EOSC-hub era.

    Context
    =======

    This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's purpose
    "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software vulnerabilities"

    The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling procedure [R 4]  in the context of how the
    software is used in the EGI infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be correct.
    The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on how the software is used.
