    Title:       EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] MODERATE risk - Disk Pool Manager (DPM) logging may contain sensitive information
     [EGI-SVG-2020-16835]

    Affected software and risk
    ==========================

    'MODERATE' risk vulnerability concerning Disk Pool manager (DPM) [R 1] logging

    Package : DPM

    It has been found that DPM may write highly sensitive information into log files, including passwords, at higher LogLevel values which
    normally are used for debugging purposes only.


    Actions required/recommended
    ============================

    Sites which run DPM should check their logging level, see [R 2] and ensure that for routine operations the
    LogLevel is set to 1 or 0.  Such logs will not contain sensitive information.

    If sites are running at a higher LogLevel (e.g. for debugging purposes) they should take extra care of these logs,
    in particular if they need to share them for some reason, e.g. with DPM experts. Do not send such logs to mailing
    lists and do not attach them to GGUS tickets, unless all sensitive information has first been removed.

    Sites will normally wish to run their DPM logging at no higher than LogLevel 1 anyway, as higher levels tend to use a
    lot of disk space and may lower the performance.


    More information
    ================

    Future DPM versions may exclude highly sensitive information at all LogLevel values.

    Context
    =======

    This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's purpose
    "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software vulnerabilities"

    The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling procedure [R 3]
    in the context of how the software is used in the EGI infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group,
    we do not guarantee it to be correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on how the software is used.
