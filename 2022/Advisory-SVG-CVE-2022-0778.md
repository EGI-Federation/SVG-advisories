Affected software and risk
==========================

Vulnerability concerning OpenSSL

Package    : OpenSSL 
CVE ID     : CVE-2022-0778
Bug ID     :  
CVSS Score : 

A DoS vulnerability has been announced in OpenSSL, affecting OpenSSL versions 
1.0.2, 1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 3.0. [R 1]  EGI SVG considers this vulnerability to have 
a limited risk to EGI sites.

Actions required/recommended
============================

For most sites no urgent action is recommended.

If sites find they are running a vulnerable version of OpenSSL they should 
consider updating to avoid a DoS at their sites. 

If anyone becomes aware of any situation where this vulnerability has a 
significant impact on the EGI infrastructure then please inform EGI SVG.

Component installation information
==================================

If necessary, see your relevant software provider.

Affected software details
=========================

OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.0, 1.1.1 and 3.0. [R 1]

RHEL7 and RHEL8 and derivatives do not appear to be affected  [R 2] 

Ubuntu [R 3] and Debian [R 4] have some limited exposure.


More information
================

The EGI SVG is issuing this INFORMATION because some sites are asking about 
it, it is being talked about a lot,  and other infrastructures are issuing 
an advisory. 

The EGI SVG considers the possibility of a DoS at one site to be less serious 
than, for example, a privilege escalation vulnerability. 

The combination of this being a DoS and their being little likelihood of many 
sites being affected means it is not considered to be a serious risk to EGI.
