Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE]  HIGH risk OpenSSL-3.0.X  
         vulnerability CVE-2022-3602 [EGI-SVG-CVE-2022-3602] 

Date:    2022-11-01
Updated: 2022-11-30

Affected software and risk
==========================
HIGH risk vulnerability concerning OpenSSL3 

Package    : OpenSSL 3
CVE ID     : CVE-2022-3602 
Bug ID     : 2137723 
CVSS Score : 7.5 [R 2]

The OpenSSL project have released OpenSSL 3.0.7 which is a security fix. [R 1].  
CVE-2022-3602 consists of a buffer overrun which can be triggered by sending 
an X.509 certificate with a specially crafted email address field to a 
vulnerable client or server.    This can result in an overflow of four 
attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This could result in a crash 
(causing a denial of service) or possibly result in remote code execution. 
[R 3]. 

OpenSSL3 is the OS version for OpenSSL on RHEL9.
 
There are other distributions where OpenSSL3 is in use. 

The majority of EGI sites are unlikely to be affected.  


Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites using OpenSSL3 prior to 3.0.7 should update as soon as possible.

Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RHEL 9 should see [R 2] [R 4]

Sites running CentOS should also see [R 2] plus [R 5] 

Sites running Debian should see [R 6]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 7]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 8] 

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 9] [R 10]

Affected software details
=========================
These vulnerabilities are fixed in OpenSSL version 3.0.7.  
Earlier versions of OpenSSL3 are affected.

OpenSSL3 is distributed with RHEL 9 and derivates.  Earlier versions of RHEL 
and its derivatives are not affected.
Some Debian distributions may be affected [R 7] but unlikely to be used on 
the production infrastructure.

Ubuntu 22.04 is affected, which is present in some cloud images.
