Affected software and risk
==========================

Up to 'CRITICAL' risk vulnerability concerning Java 15 and later

Package    : Java
CVE ID     : CVE-2022-21449
Bug ID     : 
CVSS Score : 7.5 [R 1] 

A vulnerability has been found in Java, involving Improper Verification of 
Cryptographic Signature. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result 
in unauthorized creation, deletion or modification access to critical data 
[R 2].  This affects one of the default versions of the OpenJDK shipped 
with RHEL 8 and its derivatives. None of the official RHEL7 (and derivatives) 
OpenJDK versions are affected.

Exposure within the EGI infrastructure seems limited, but sites are urged to 
check locally for services running Java 15 and up.


Actions required/recommended
============================

Those running any of the versions of the OpenJDK included in RHEL 7 and its 
derivatives are unlikely to be affected and do not need to take action.

Services which use Java and run RHEL 8 and its derivatives, or install Java 
from other sources should check that they are not running a vulnerable version 
and take action to update if they are.  

If anyone becomes aware of any situation where this vulnerability is exposed 
on the EGI infrastructure then please inform EGI SVG.

Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RHEL should see [R 2]

Sites running CentOS should also see [R 2]

Sites running Debian should see [R 3]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 4]
