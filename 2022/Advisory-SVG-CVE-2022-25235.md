Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] CRITICAL risk Vulnerabilities 
         concerning expat XML parser CVE-2022-25235, CVE-2022-25236 
         [EGI-SVG-CVE-2022-25235]  

Date:        2022-03-31
Updated:     2023-12-06

Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerabilities concerning the expat XML parser. 

Package    : expat XML parser
CVE ID     : CVE-2022-25235, CVE-2022-25236
Bug ID     : 
CVSS Score : 9.8

Vulnerabilities have been found concerning the expat XML parser, including 
two which may lead to arbitrary code execution. [R 1], [R 2], [R 3].  
The expat XML parser is a library, written in C, which is a dependency for
various other software.  

So far the only use we have established in EGI is the VOMS server, but we 
are continuing to investigate and ask various software providers if it is 
a dependency.

**UPDATE 2023-12-06** 

Other CVE's fixed in this release [R 1]

CVE-2021-45960
CVE-2021-46143
CVE-2022-22822 
CVE-2022-22823 
CVE-2022-22824 
CVE-2022-22825 
CVE-2022-22826 
CVE-2022-22827 
CVE-2022-23852 
CVE-2022-25315 

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running software which is dependent on expat should update urgently, 
including those running a VOMS server.  They should then re-start the 
service. 


Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RHEL should see [R 1] [R 2]

Sites running CentOS should also see [R 1], [R 2], [R 4]  

Sites running Scientific Linux should see [R 5]

Sites running Debian should see [R 6]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 7]
(Ubuntu does not seem to be affected)

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 8]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 9] 


Mitigation
==========

No mitigation is available.


More information
================

While the vendor advisories just mention certain supported products that 
happen to depend on "expat", please note the library provided by that 
package can be used by other products, like the VOMS server.

As an example, mod_shib also uses libexpat, i.e. Apache httpd using 
shibboleth also needs updating and restarting.
