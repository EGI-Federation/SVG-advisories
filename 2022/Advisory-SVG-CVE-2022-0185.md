Title:       EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] CRITICAL risk - 
             Heap buffer overflow vulnerability in linux kernel - 
             RHEL 8 and derivatives [EGI-SVG-CVE-2022-0185] 

Date:        2022-01-25
Updated:     

Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning Linux kernel

Package : Linux kernel
CVE ID  : CVE-2022-0185
Bug ID  : 2040358

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the legacy_parse_param function in the Filesystem Context functionality of the Linux kernel verified the supplied parameters length which could be used for privilege escalation. [R 1], [R 2], [R 3]

Note that this only affects RHEL 8 and its derivatives, and probably only affects sites within EGI which enable containers. [R 4]  It does not affect RHEL 7 and its derivatives. 


Actions required/recommended
============================

All affected running resources MUST be either patched or have mitigation
in place or software removed by 2022-02-02  00:00 UTC

Sites failing to act and/or failing to respond to requests from the EGI CSIRT team risk site suspension.


Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RHEL 8 should see [R 1], [R 2]

Sites running CentOS 8 should also see [R 1], [R 2] 

Sites running Debian should see [R 5] 

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 6]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 7], [R 8]

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 9], [R 10]


Mitigation
==========

It is possible to mitigate this by disabling unprivileged user namespaces.

To disable on Centos 8: :--

echo "user.max_user_namespaces = 0" \
    > /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_user_namespaces.conf
root@host # sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/90-max_user_namespaces.conf

Also see [R 4]
