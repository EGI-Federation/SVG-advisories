Introduction
============

The EGI Software vulnerability group has been alerted to a vulnerability in the
APEL server.
This vulnerability has been eliminated from the software, and installed on the
APEL server.
As there is only 1 instance of the APEL server, and the client is unaffected,
no action needs to be taken by sites.

vulnerability has been found in the APEL server software. Depending on the
target SQL database engine and its version, injection can result in reading of
