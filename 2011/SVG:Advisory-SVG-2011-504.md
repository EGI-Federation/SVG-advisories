Mitigation
==========

If APEL is co-located with another service  (e.g. a CE) then sites may wish to
check and change the file permission on the /etc/grid-security/ keystore if
necessary.

This should be carried out by sites who are not planning to upgrade shortly.


Component Installation information
==================================

The official repository for the distribution of grid middleware for EGI sites
is repository.egi.eu which contains the EGI Unified Middleware Distrbution
(UMD).

Sites using the EGI UMD should see:

Sites installing directly from EMI may upgrade directly from EMI if they
haven't done so already see:

Recommendations
===============

Sites installing from the EGI UMD or directly from EMI should update their
sites in due course.

upgrading soon or following the Mitigation.
