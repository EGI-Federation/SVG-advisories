Introduction
============
A vulnerability has been found in the dCache Admin Web Interface software which
is part of the dCache distribution.
dCache is one of the Mass Storage Systems commonly used in EGI production
environment [R1]


Details
=======
A specially constructed http request, sent to the dCache admin web interface,
allows unauthenticated remote users to read arbitrary files on the host where
the dCache server httpdDomain is running, with 'root' privileges.
The access is read-only. Creating, modifying or executing files is not
possible. The pnfs/Chimera-file system is not affected.


Risk Category
=============
This issue has been assessed as 'Critical' risk by the EGI CSIRT and EGI SVG
Risk Assessment Team


Affected Software
=================
Components : dCache server
Subcomponent : httpdDomain
Service : dCache Admin Web Server
Since : since ever

Releases : all supported dCache server releases *prior* to:
   1.9.5-25
   1.9.10-7
   1.9.11-4

Note that the version released/to be released in EMI is not affected.
Information available at [R2]

Component Installation information
==================================
Currently software updates are available  from the dcache web-site [R1] -
instructions are available in [R 2].

Sites using
1.9.5  should update to  1.9.5.25 and above (e.g. those installed from gLite)
1.9.10 should update to  1.9.10-7 and above
1.9.11 should update to  1.9.11-4 and above

EMI - Will include 1.9.5 -25 therefore a fixed version will be in EMI.

Note, it is only necessary to  upgrade the node running the httpdDomain.

Updated 2011-04-07:

Updated version is now available in gLite for gLite 3.2/

gLite 3.2:

Release details may be found at


http://glite.cern.ch/R3.2/sl5_x86_64/updates/27/


Mitigation
=======
1. Only allow access to the dCache admin web interface (Port 2288) to
dedicated trusted hosts, using appropriate local firewall settings.

2. Run the httpdDomain as non-root where possible.

3. Run an apache webserver in front of the dCache admin interface with access
control enabled, which will completely block unauthorized access to the dCache
admin web server.

Detailed information on how to implement 2. and 3. are available in [R2]


Recommendations
===============
In addition, on the hosts that have been running the admin interface exposed
to the Internet it is recommended to change all passwords, keys, etc on that
machine, and carefully check the logs for signs of intrusions like unexpected
logins, etc.


Requirements:
=========
Update the affected dCache component or apply  the mitigation steps stated
above.


Other information
=================
As a basic security best practice, it is strongly recommended to restrict
access to the admin web interface with a firewall also after the security
upgrade.

EGI-CSIRT will enforce 7-day deadline, failing to act the deadline might lead
to site suspension.

All affected resources must either update the affected dCache component or apply
the mitigation actions stated above, by:

       ***2011-04-07 22:00 CEST (20:00 GMT)***


Updated 2011-04-07

Updated version of the software is now available from gLite. Sites should update their nodes
supporting httpdDomain as soon as possible, if they have not done so already.

Updating to the latest release is the only way to full resolve the vulnerabilities, sites can
either upgrade (preferred) or take the mitigation measures now and upgrade later.
