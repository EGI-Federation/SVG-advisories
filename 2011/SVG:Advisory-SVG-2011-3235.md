Introduction
============

It has been found that the BDII [R1] password is predictable when installing
the EMI top level BDII.

This has now been resolved.

=======

A previous vulnerability in BDII was found for which the EGI issued an advisory
at [R 2] and it was stated that it only applied to gLite 3.2

However, this was found to also partially apply to the EMI version of BDII.
The BDII password is predictable and not changed to a random value.

This has now been resolved in EMI and in the EGI UMD.
