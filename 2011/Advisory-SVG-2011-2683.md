Date:        2013-02-08

Introduction
============

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities has been found in DPM (Disk Pool
Manager)

A new version of DPM which resolves these vulnerabilities is now available
in the in the EMI-1 and EMI-2 distributions.

This advisory is updated as this new version is now available in
EGI UMD-1 and EGI UMD-2.


Details
=======

Insufficient input validation in parts of the DPM code allow an authenticated

in unauthorised modification of DPM metadata or, depending on the privileges of

The issue was originally assessed as 'Low' risk but some time later an exploit
was demonstrated and it was re-assessed as 'High' risk.
