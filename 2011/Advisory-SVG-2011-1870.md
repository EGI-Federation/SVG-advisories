Details
=======

Many EGI Sites use Torque (Tera-scale Open source Resource Manager and QUeue
manager) as distributed as part of EPEL.

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the Torque server. So far an
exploit has been found which allows the attacker to crash a server, but no
exploit has been found which allows an attacker to manipulate the buffer
overflow to cause specific behaviour.

This was reported to the EGI SVG (RT 1870) as well as to the Torque software
providers.
This has been fixed by the Torque providers.

The updates have also been applied to EPEL.
