Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE]  HIGH Risk mod_auth_openidc
          vulnerability [EGI-SVG-CVE-2023-37464]

Date:    2023-08-08
Updated: 2023-09-15

Affected software and risk
==========================
HIGH risk vulnerability concerning mod_auth_openidc.  [R 1]

Package    : mod_auth_openidc
CVE ID     : CVE-2023-37464
CVSS Score : 7.5

A vulnerability was found in cjose. The cjose is a C library implementing
the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) on which mod_auth_openidc
depends. The AES GCM decryption routine incorrectly uses the tag length from
the actual Authentication Tag provided in the JSON Web Encryption (JWE).
A fixed length of 16 octets must be applied. This flaw allows an attacker to
provide a truncated Authentication Tag and modify the JWE. [R 2]  This may
allow an attacker to adjust the content of encrypted JSONs.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites deploying cjose / mod_auth_openidc are recommended to update relevant
components as soon as possible, when patches are available. 

Note that this is used as part of configuring OpenStack services with support
for EGI Check-In.

If anyone becomes aware of any other situation where this vulnerability has a
significant impact on the EGI infrastructure, then please inform EGI SVG.
