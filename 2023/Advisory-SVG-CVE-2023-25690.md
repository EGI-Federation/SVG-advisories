Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE] HIGH risk Apache HTTP request 
         splitting vulnerability [EGI-SVG-CVE-2023-25690]

Date:        2023-04-06
Updated:     2023-06-08

Affected software and risk
==========================
HIGH risk vulnerability concerning Apache HTTP request splitting

Package    : Apache HTTP
CVE ID     : CVE-2023-25690 
CVSS Score : 9.8 [R 1]

A security vulnerability in the Apache web server was recently announced 
involving HTTP request splitting with mod_rewrite and mod_proxy (CVE-2023-25690). 
The bug is only present when certain configuration options are in place, but 
the potential impact to affected systems is severe [R 1]

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to update relevant components as soon as possible, 
if they have not done so already.  

**UPDATE 2023-06-08**

This is fixed for RHEL8 and RHEL9 and deriviatives, as well as RHEL 7 and 
derivatives. [R 1] 


Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RHEL should see [R 1] 

Sites running CentOS should also see [R 2] 

Sites running Scientific Linux should see [R 3]

Sites running Debian should see [R 4]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 5]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 6] 

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 7]


More information
================

This information is provided provided by OSG

If your Apache web servers have mod_proxy enabled, and your configuration 
makes use of the RewriteRule or ProxyPassReverse options, you should install 
the updated Apache web server packages when they are available for your 
systems and restart the Apache web server.

All Linux systems running Apache HTTP server 2.4.0 - 2.4.55 are affected by 
this vulnerability.


An example of possible exploit - something like:

RewriteEngine on

RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]

ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/

Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in 
the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, 
and cache poisoning.
