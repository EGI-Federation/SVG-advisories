Title:   EGI SVG 'ALERT' [TLP:CLEAR] Zenbleed (CVE-2023-20593) 

Date:    2023-07-26
Updated: 2023-08-15, 2023-09-21

Affected software and risk
==========================

A speculative execution vulnerability has been discovered in AMD Zen 2 CPUs.
This vulnerability has been dubbed "Zenbleed".    [R 1]
A malicious actor could steal sensitive data, such as passwords and encryption keys,
resident in the CPU cores. Sensitive data could be extracted from any system operations,
including those that take place in virtual machines, isolated sandbox environments,
and containers. Even a malicious webpage, running some carefully crafted JavaScript,
could exploit Zenbleed to snoop on information.

We note that some sites are using AMD Zen 2 (e.g. EPYC Rome) CPUs, therefore are
alerting sites to this problem. We do not know how easy or difficult it actually is to
exploit this problem across EGI, but please see the "More information" section below.


Actions required/recommended
============================

**UPDATE 2023-09-21**

Updates from Red Hat are also now available. [R 7]

Sites using AMD Zen 2 CPUs are recommended to apply vendor updates and if not
available consider mitigation. 

Component installation information
==================================

Sites should see information from their vendor.
Updates relating to RHEL8 and RHEL9 are also available [R 7]

Mitigation
==========

An option for mitigation is available at [R 2]

More information
================

One colleague has tested an exploit, and was able to make it work, as well
as the documented mitigation.

An excellent description and information on mitigation is provided by
trustedci at [R 3]

More information is available at [R 2], [R 4], [R 5]

**UPDATE 2023-08-15 further reference added**

Also see information from Dell [R 6]

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue
handling procedure [R 99]  in the context of how the software is used in
the EGI infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee
it to be correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments
 depending on how the software is used.
