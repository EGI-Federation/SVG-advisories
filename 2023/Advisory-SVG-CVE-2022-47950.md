Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE]  CRITICAL risk Arbitrary file access 
         through custom S3 XML entities in Swift's XML parser 
         [EGI-SVG-CVE-2022-47950]  

Date:    2023-01-23
Updated: 2023-04-11

Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning Swift's S3 XML parser affecting OpenStack

Package    : Swift S3 XML parser 
CVE ID     : CVE-2022-47950
CVSS Score : 7.7 [R 1]

A flaw was found in Swift's S3 XML parser. By supplying specially crafted XML files, 
an authenticated user may coerce the S3 API into returning arbitrary file contents 
from the host server, resulting in unauthorized read access to potentially
sensitive data. [R 1] [R 2] [R 3]

EGI FedCLoud sites are vulnerable.  

Actions required/recommended
============================

EGI Cloud sites running OpenStack are required to either update relevant 
components or carry out mitigation below urgently. 

All running resources MUST be either patched or have mitigation
in place or software removed by 2023-01-31  00:00 UTC

All sites running OpenStack should update as a precaution. 

Component installation information
==================================

Sites running OpenStack provided by RHEL should see [R 1] 

Others should refer to OpenStack notification - included below.

Mitigation
===========

Disable S3-compatibility


OpenStack Notification
======================

Title:-
[openstack-announce] [OSSA-2023-001] Swift: Arbitrary file access through custom S3 XML entities (CVE-2022-47950)


:Date: January 17, 2023
:CVE: CVE-2022-47950


Affects
~~~~~~~
- Swift: <2.28.1, >=2.29.0 <2.29.2, ==2.30.0


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Sebastien Meriot (OVH) reported a vulnerability in Swift's S3 XML parser. By supplying specially crafted XML files an authenticated user may coerce the S3 API into returning arbitrary file contents from the host server resulting in unauthorized read access to potentially sensitive data; this impacts both s3api deployments (Rocky or later), and swift3 deployments (Queens and earlier, no longer actively developed). Only deployments with S3 compatibility enabled are affected.

More information
================

The EGI SVG considers this vulnerability to be 'CRITICAL' in the EGI FedCloud 
because members of the VOs supported by sites with OpenStack swift normally 
have access to this service.
So this can potentially be exploited by any member of the supported VOs. 
This is exploitable without the need to create a VM in FedCloud, swift-s3 can 
be accessed directly without a VM, it's normally a publicly accessible API.

As far as the EGI SVG is aware, only FedCloud sites within EGI running OpenStack 
are exploitabe by users. 
Grid jobs do not use OpenStack directly. The vulnerability is exploitable by 
whoever created the WN but not the Grid user.  The vulnerability is only 
exploitable by the person who has access to swift.
