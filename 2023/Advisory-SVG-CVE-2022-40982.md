Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:CLEAR]  HIGH risk Intel Downfall Vulnerability
[EGI-SVG-CVE-2022-40982]

Date:    2023-08-16
Updated: 2023-10-19

Affected software and risk
==========================

HIGH risk vulnerability concerning some Intel processors 

Package    : Intel processor firmware
CVE ID     : CVE-2022-40982
CVSS Score : 6.5 [R 1]

A potential security vulnerability in some Intel® Processors may allow
information disclosure.  Intel is releasing firmware updates and an optional
software sequence to mitigate this potential vulnerability. [R 2] [R 3] 
    
    
Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites are recommended to check whether their processors are affected, and if
they are update when updates are available. 

Intel recommends that users of affected Intel® Processors update to the
latest version firmware provided by the system manufacturer that addresses
these issues. 

Various linux providers have or plan to provide this intel microcode fix as
part of their distributions, and sites may find it more convenient to update
from this route. 

However, as there are reports of potentially significant, workflow-dependent
performance degradations that a site may deem unacceptable at this time, there
is a flag in the microcode to turn off the mitigation, as detailed further
e.g. in [R 4].


Component installation information
==================================

Sites who wish to update soon should see the intel page [R 1]

Sites running RHEL should see [R 4], [R 5] 

Note that RedHat states that "this microcode update will be made available by
Red Hat in a further release of the `microcode_ctl` package. [R 4]

**UPDATE 2023-10-19**
RedHat said on 6th October 2023 'Solution Verified' as the updating
of the microcode firmware to version 20230808 or later.

Sites running CentOS should also see [R 4], [R 5], [R 6]

Sites running Debian should see [R 7]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 8]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 9] 

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 10]


Mitigation
==========

The vulnerability can be mitigated by installing updated CPU microcode,
Version 20230808 or later. [R 4]


More information
================

Although RedHat and others consider this to be 'Medium' risk, with a
CVSS score of 6.5, we the EGI SVG consider it to be 'High' risk because
for Grid and Cloud computing processors are accessible by a number of people.
In [R 3] for example, it states that in cloud computing environments, a
malicious customer could exploit the Downfall vulnerability to steal data
and credentials from other customers who share the same cloud computer.
    
Some performance degradation has been reported resulting from these updates.
At present, we do not know to what extent grid and cloud workflows at EGI
sites may be affected.
    
TLP and URL
===========

** CLEAR information - Unimited distribution

Context
=======

This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's
purpose "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software
vulnerabilities"
The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 99] in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be
correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on
how the software is used.
