**UPDATE 2023-06-22** 
This is now fixed for RHEL9, and hopefully for derivatives shortly [R 1]

**UPDATE 2023-06-13**
This is now fixed for RHEL8 and derivatives. [R 1] 

Sites running RHEL8 and RHEL9 and derivatives should update, urgently if
they do not have mitigation in place.

As this is not fixed for RHEL7 and derivatives, sites whould put mitigation
in place if they have not done so already.

==================================

Sites running RHEL should see [R 1]

Sites running CentOS should also see [R 1] and [R 2] 

Sites running Scientific Linux should see [R 3]

Sites running Debian should see [R 4]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 5]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 6] 

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 7]
