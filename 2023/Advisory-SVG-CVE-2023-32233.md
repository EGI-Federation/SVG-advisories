Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE]  CRITICAL risk
          Netfilter nf_tables use-after-free flaw

Date:        2023-05-11
Updated:     2023-06-12, 2023-06-22, 2023-09-15

Affected software and risk
==========================

CRITICAL risk vulnerability concerning Linux kernel Netfilter nf_tables 

Package    : Linux kernel Netfilter nf_tables 
CVE ID     : CVE-2023-32233
CVSS Score : 7.8  [R 1]

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Netfilter nf_tables
(net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c) in the Linux kernel.
In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker must have CAP_NET_ADMIN
privileges and be able to manipulate netfilter entries.
This vulnerability may lead to arbitrary code execution, and kernel
information leak issue. [R 1]

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites should urgently consider mitigation if they have not done so already.
**UPDATE 2023-06-22** 
This is now fixed for RHEL9, and hopefully for derivatives shortly [R 1]

**UPDATE 2023-06-13**
This is now fixed for RHEL8 and derivatives. [R 1] 

Sites running RHEL8 and RHEL9 and derivatives should update, urgently if
they do not have mitigation in place.

As this is not fixed for RHEL7 and derivatives, and appears unlikely to be,
sites should put mitigation in place if they have not done so already.

Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RHEL should see [R 1]

Sites running CentOS should also see [R 1] and [R 2] 

Sites running Scientific Linux should see [R 3]

Sites running Debian should see [R 4]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 5]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 6] 

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 7]

Mitigation
==========

Disabling (some of the) linux namespaces may fully or partially mitigate
this vulnerability. 
In particular, this vulnerability appears to be mitigated provided
unprivileged network namespaces are NOT enabled.
Best practices on namespaces and containers is provided on the
CSIRT webpage [R 8]

Note that both Red Hat and Ubuntu recommend Mitigation. 
See [R 1], [R 5]
