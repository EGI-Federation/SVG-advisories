Title:   EGI SVG 'ADVISORY' [TLP:WHITE]  HIGH risk - Use-after-free flaw affecting RHEL8.  [EGI-SVG-CVE-2022-41222]

Date:    2023-02-24
Updated: 2023-04-21

Affected software and risk
==========================

HIGH risk vulnerability concerning Linux kernel’s mm/mremap memory 
address space

Package    : Linux kernel 
CVE ID     : CVE-2022-41222
CVSS Score : 7.0 [R 1]

A race condition was found in the Linux kernel’s mm/mremap memory address 
space accounting implementation, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. 
This flaw allows a local user to cause a system crash or potentially 
escalate their privileges on the system. On RHEL it only affects RHEL 8 
and derivatives. [R 1]
It is only exploitable by a local user.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running RHEL8 and derivatives are recommended to update relevant 
components as soon as possible in the case of Grid Worker Nodes and 
User Interfaces. 

Others may want to check if their distribution or service types are 
vulnerable, such as some Debian Versions [R 3] and whether their type 
of service is potentially vulnerable (such as hosts running containers.)

If anyone becomes aware of any situation where this vulnerability has 
a significant impact on the EGI infrastructure (in addition to Grid Worker 
Nodes and shared User interfaces) then please inform EGI SVG. 


Component installation information
==================================

Sites running RHEL should see [R 1]

Sites running CentOS should also see [R 1], and [R 2] 

Sites running Debian should see [R 3]

Sites running Ubuntu should see [R 4]

Sites running RockyLinux should see [R 5] 

Sites running Almalinux should see [R 6]

More information
================

This vulnerability affects RHEL8 and deriviatives [R 1], and Debian [R 3]. 

The vulnerability can be exploited only by a local user. Hence Grid sites 
should update Worker Nodes and shared User Interfaces are vulnerable.  

Note that Scientific Linux is based on RHEL7 therefore is not affected.
