## 'ADVISORY' [TLP:CLEAR] HIGH risk Linux kernel vulnerability [EGI-SVG-2023-33]

Date: 2023-05-17

A HIGH risk Use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s TLS protocol,
affecting RHEL8 and RHEL9 and their derivatives.

## IDs AND CVSS SCORE

EGI SVG ID : EGI-SVG-2023-33

CVE ID : CVE-2023-0461

CVSS Score : 7.8 [R 1]

## ACTIONS REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED

Affected sites are recommended to update relevant components as soon as
possible.

Sites should update the relevant components using the RedHat or other vendor
updates, see references below.

## MORE INFORMATION

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s TLS protocol
functionality in how a user installs a TLS context (struct tls_context) on a
connected TCP socket. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially
escalate their privileges on the system [R 1]. For RHEL this only affects
RHEL8 and RHEL9 and their derivatives, 7 and its derivatives are not affected.

The vulnerability can be exploited only by a local user. Hence sites should
update their affected Grid Worker Nodes, User Interfaces and other shared user
systems as the risk may be higher than suggested by the CVSS score.

Note that Scientific Linux is based on RHEL7 therefore is not affected.
