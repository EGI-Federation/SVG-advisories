Title:   EGI SVG 'ALERT' [TLP:CLEAR] Two BMC vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-34329)

Date:    2023-07-27
Updated: 

Affected software and risk
==========================

The two security flaws enable attackers to bypass authentication or inject
malicious code via Redfish remote management interfaces exposed to remote
access: 

CVE-2023-34329 - Authentication Bypass via HTTP Header Spoofing
CVE-2023-34330 - Code injection via Dynamic Redfish Extension interface 

See [R 1] [R 2] [R 3]

The EGI SVG is aware that sites may use the remote management interface to
 manage their deployments.  Both these vulnerabilities require adjacent or
local network as well as high privileges in order to be exploited. If sites
carry out best practice in their deployment  and ensure this service is only
accessible to those who manage the site, it should not be possible to exploit
these vulnerabilities.

Actions required/recommended
============================

Sites running vulnerable servers should urgently apply vendor updates.

Administrators should make sure that all remote server management interfaces
such as Redfish and the BMC subsystems in their environments are not exposed
externally. BMC interface access should be restricted to administrative users
with Access Control Lists (ACL) in place.
Disable default built-in administrative accounts that might be provided by the
vendors, check if your vendor already provided a firmware upgrade that mitigates
these vulnerabilities. A unique, well-protected admin account configuration for
your management systems is usually a good practice.

One case where sites may be vulnerable, is if Cloud users who have root access
inside their VMs have unrestricted access to local networks and might thus be
able to contact BMC endpoints. 

If anyone becomes aware of any situation where this vulnerability has a
significant impact on the EGI infrastructure then please inform EGI SVG.

Component installation information
==================================

Sites should see information from their vendor.


TLP and URL
===========

** CLEAR information - Unlimited distribution - see

2023-07-07 SVG alerted to this issue by Barbara Krasovec
2023-07--- Investigation of vulnerability and relevance to EGI carried out
2023-07-26 EGI SVG decided to send alert to sites, as a small number may be vulnerable.
2023-07-27 Alert sent to sites


Context
=======

This advisory has been prepared as part of the effort to fulfil EGI SVG's
purpose "To minimize the risk to the EGI infrastructure arising from software
vulnerabilities"

The risk is that assessed by the group, according to the EGI SVG issue handling
procedure [R 5] in the context of how the software is used in the EGI
infrastructure. It is the opinion of the group, we do not guarantee it to be
correct. The risk may also be higher or lower in other deployments depending on
how the software is used.

Others may re-use this information provided they:-

1) Respect the provided TLP classification

2) Credit the EGI https://www.egi.eu/ Software Vulnerability Group
------------------------------

Note that the SVG issue handling procedure is currently under review, to take
account of the increasing inhomogeneity of the EGI infrastructure and the
services in the EOSC catalogue.
